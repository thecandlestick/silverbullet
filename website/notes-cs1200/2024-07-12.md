## Helpful Counting Theorems

When looking at repeated random experiments or random processes with multiple steps, computing probabilities will often require counting the number of possible combinations of outcomes or decisions

#Definition Two events are **independent** if and only if the outcome of one event has no effect on the outcome of the other

#Theorem (_The Multiplication Rule_): Consider a process which consists of _k_ _independent_ steps.
```latex
\text{Let }n_1\text{ represent the number of ways to perform step }1\\
\text{Let }n_2\text{ represent the number of ways to perform step }2\\
...\\
\text{Let }n_k\text{ represent the number of ways to perform step }3\\
\text{Then the number of ways to perform the whole process is }n_1n_2...n_k
```

_example:_ **Guessing Passwords**

Suppose you want to know the probability of randomly guessing an 8-digit password which can contain the characters {0-9,a-z,A-Z} and has no other restrictions

If we suppose that every password is equally likely, and that whatever guess we make is also uniform random, then it suffices to know what is the total number of possible 8-digit passwords

Model the process of creating a password as an operation involving 8 independent steps, one for selecting each character

**Number of ways to select the first character:**

  There are 10 numerical digits, 26 lowercase letters, and 26 uppercase letters which gives us a total of **62** options

Because there are no further restrictions, we can reason that there are the same number of options for the remaining 7 characters.

Therefore, _by the multiplication rule_, the number of ways to generate a unique password is 
  **62(62)(62)(62)(62)(62)(62)(62) = 218,340,105,584,896**

Consider this as the size of our _sample space_. The size of the _event_ ‚Äúthe generated password matches the first guess exactly‚Äù is 1

The probability of guessing a randomly generated password is then:
```latex
P(\text{correct guess}) = \frac{1}{218340105584896} \approx 0.00000000000000458
```

#DiscussionQuestion How might this probabilistic model of password-guessing differ from a real-world scenario? Is there anything an attacker could exploit to improve their odds of guessing correctly? Is there anything a user can do to decrease the odds of their password being guessed?

_example:_ **Anagrams**

Let us suppose a different scenario where a theoretical attacker has physical access to your computer (which is password-protected) and makes a keen observation that some keys on your keyboard are significantly more worn than others.

![](../img/worn-keyboard.jpg)

The attacker makes the assumption that your password likely consists of these characters. Furthermore, because no one key is more worn than the rest, they reason that there are no repeated characters. Each of the 8 slightly-faded characters appears exactly once.

In this scenario, how likely is the attacker to guess your password? In other words, how many passwords could you create using exactly those 8 characters?

To model this problem, let us again consider selecting a character of the password as one step in a multi-stage process.

**Ways to select the first character:** 8
**Ways to select the second character:** 7
**...**
**Ways to select the eighth character:** 1

_Using the multiplication rule_
**Total number of possible passwords:** 8x7x6x5x4x3x2x1

probability: 0.00002480158

## Permutations

#Definition A **permutation** of a finite set is a _total ordering_ of the elements

#Theorem The number of permutations of a set with **n** elements is **n(n-1)...(2)(1) = n!**

#Definition An **r-permutation** of a set with **n** elements is an ordered selection of **r** elements taken from the set (without replacement). The number of _r-permutations_ of a set of **n** elements is denoted **P(n,r)**

#Theorem If **n** and **r** are integers such that **1 <= r <= n**, then the total number of _r-permutations_ of a set of **n** elements is given by the formula:
```latex
P(n,r) = n(n-1)(n-2)...(n-r+1) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}
```

_example:_ **non-repeating passwords**

Consider adding the restriction that passwords cannot contain duplicate characters. With only this restriction, how many 8-character passwords can we create?

We could model this from scratch, or we could observe that generating a valid password this way is the same as selecting 8 valid but unique characters and putting them in a specific order.

The total number of non-repeating passwords is therefore the same as the number of _8-permutations_ of a set with _62_ elements or **P(62,8)**
```latex
P(62,8) = \frac{62!}{(62-8)!} = \frac{62!}{54!}
```

**62!** and **54!** are too big to calculate directly (conveniently), but we can cancel some terms to simplify
```latex
\frac{62!}{54!} = \frac{62(61)...(54)(53)...(2)(1)}{54(53)...(2)(1)}
= \frac{62(61)...\cancel{(54)(53)...(2)(1)}}{\cancel{54(53)...(2)(1)}}
= \frac{62(61)(60)(59)(58)(57)(56)(55)}{1}
```
This gives us a total of **136,325,893,334,400** possible non-repeating passwords

#Theorem (_The Addition Rule_): Suppose finite set **A** is the union of **k** mutually disjoint subsets
```latex
A = A_1 \cup A_2 \cup ... \cup A_k
```
Then the number of elements in **A** is the sum of the number of elements in each subset
```latex
|A| = |A_1| + |A_2| + ... + |A_k|
```

_example:_ **variable-length passwords**

Suppose that we allow a password to range from 4-8 characters. How does this change the total number of possible passwords?

We can apply the _addition rule_ to figure this out. Consider the following sets:
* **P** - The set of all passwords
* **A** - The set of all 8-character passwords
* **B** - The set of all 7-character passwords
* **C** - The set of all 6-character passwords
* **D** - The set of all 5-character passwords
* **E** - The set of all 4-character passwords 

Clearly,
```latex
P = A \cup B \cup C \cup D \cup E
```
Thus, to figure out **|P|** we first need to calculate

* **|A|** = 218,340,105,584,896
* **|B|** = 62^7
* **|C|** = 62^6
* **|D|** = 62^5
* **|E|** = 62^4

Therefore, the total number of possible passwords is 
**|P|** = 62^8 + 62^7 + 62^6 + 62^5 + 62

#Theorem (_The Difference Rule_): Suppose set **B** is a subset of a finite set **A**, then
```latex
|A-B| = |A| - |B|
```

_example:_ **non-dictionary passwords**

A common tactic for attackers is to not guess a password randomly, but instead focus on guessing passwords that spell out English words. The reasoning is that these passwords are much easier to remember for the users and thus more likely to be chosen

Suppose that we add a restriction to our 8-character passwords that they cannot be words found in the dictionary. For reference, the official Scrabble¬Æ Dictionary contains **80148** 8-letter words. In this case, how many valid passwords can we generate?
