# Functions

#Definition A function **f** from a set **X** to a set **Y**, denoted **f: X -> Y**, is relation from **X**, the **domain**, to **Y**, the **co-domain**. Functions must satisfy the following properties:
* Every element in **X** is related to some element in **Y**
* No element in **X** is related to more than one element in **Y**


# Properties of Functions

## Injective Functions

#Definition A _function_ **f: X->Y** is called an **injective function** or **one-to-one** if and only if for _any_ two elements **a, b** from the _domain_, if **f(a) = f(b)** then **a = b**
```latex
f: X \rightarrow Y \text{ is injective} \Leftrightarrow \forall a,b\in X, f(a) = f(b) \rightarrow a = b
```

Another way to interpret this property is that no two _distinct_ elements of the _domain_ can share the same _output_.
```latex
f: X \rightarrow Y \text{ is injective} \Leftrightarrow \forall a,b\in X, a \ne b \rightarrow f(a) \ne f(b)
```

To prove that a function is not _injective_, it suffices to show that there exists two distinct inputs from the _domain_ that produce the same output
```latex
f: X \rightarrow Y \text{ is not injective} \Leftrightarrow \exists a,b\in X\text{ such that } f(a) = f(b) \land a \ne b
```

#DiscussionQuestion Are the following _injective functions_?
```latex
f(x):\R \rightarrow \R = 4x - 1\\
g(n):\R \rightarrow \R = n^2
```

## Surjective Functions

#Definition A function **f: X->Y** is called a **surjective function** or **onto** if and only if for _any_ element **y** of the _co-domain_, there exists some element **x** of the _domain_ such that **f(x) = y**
```latex
f: X \rightarrow Y\text{ is surjective }\Leftrightarrow \forall y \in Y, \exists x \in X \text{ such that }f(x) = y
```


Another way to interpret this property is that the _range of f_ is equal to the _co-domain of f_.
```latex
f: X \rightarrow Y\text{ is surjective }\Leftrightarrow Y = \{f(x) \mid x \in X\}
```


To prove that a function is not _surjective_, you must find an element of the _co-domain_ that is not related to by any element from the _domain_
```latex
f: X \rightarrow Y \text{ is not surjective }\Leftrightarrow \exists y \in Y \text{ such that }\forall x \in X, f(x) \ne y
```


#DiscussionQuestion Are the following _surjective_ functions?
```latex
f(x):\R \rightarrow \R = 2x+2\\
h(n):\Z \rightarrow \Z = 4n-1
```

## Bijections & Inverse Functions

#Definition A function **f: X -> Y** is called a **bijection** or **one-to-one correspondence** from **X** to **Y** if and only if **f** is both _injective_ and _surjective_

_example:_

Let **S** be the set of all finite-length strings
Consider the function **r: S -> S** where:

  **r(s)** = the string composed of the characters in **s** in reverse order

* Is **r** _injective/one-to-one_?
* Is **r** _surjective/onto?_


Let **P({a,b})** be the _power-set_ of **{a,b}** and **h: P({a,b})->{0,1}x{0,1}** be defined as:

  **h(A)** = **(c,d)** 
where **c = 1** if **a** is in **A** or **c = 0** otherwise
and **d = 1** if **b** is in **A** or **d = 0** otherwise

Draw an arrow diagram of **h** and determine if it is a _bijection_

#Definition The **inverse function** of a _bijection_ **f: X -> Y** is the function **fâ€™: Y -> X** that, given an element **y** in **Y**, produces as output the unique element **x** in **X** such that **f(x) = y**
```latex
\text{let }f:X\rightarrow Y\text{ be any bijective function}\\
f^{-1}(y):Y\rightarrow X\text{ is the inverse of }f \Leftrightarrow \forall y \in Y, (f^{-1}(y) = x) \Leftrightarrow (y = f(x))
```

#DiscussionQuestion Think back to the definition of a function, is it necessary for a function to be a _bijection_ in order to have an _inverse_? Does every _bijection_ have an _inverse_ function?

_example:_

Let **r** be the string-reversing function defined above. What is the _inverse function_ for **r**? 

Let **f: R->R** be defined as 

  **f(x) = 4x - 1** for all real numbers **x**

Find the inverse function by algebra

_recall:_ **fâ€™(y)** = the unique real number **x** such that **f(x) = y**
```latex
\quad f(x) = y\\
\Leftrightarrow 4x - 1 = y\\
\Leftrightarrow x = \frac{y + 1}{4}

```

Therefore, **fâ€™(y) = (y+1)/4**
