```latex
A = \{ m \in \Z \mid m = 6r + 12 \text{ for some int r}\}\\
B = \{ n \in \Z \mid n = 3s \text{ for some int s} \}
```

suppose _a_ is some arbitrary element of A.
Then _a_ = 6r + 12 for some int r
_a_ = 6r + 12 = 3(2r + 4)
let s = 2r + 4, which is an int by closure
Therefore _a_ = 3s where s is an int and _a_ must be an element of B.
Thus, A IS a subset of B

3 is an element of b (s = 1), but 3 is not an element of A.
Therefore B is NOT a subset of A
