Trees are a very special mathematical object that have inspired many data structures and abstract data types. Even outside the realm of data structures, trees appear throughout the field of computer science in the most unexpected of places.

Trees will also be our first foray into _non-sequential_ data representations. Instead of a _linear ordering_ of the data like that of the _sequence-based_ abstract data types weâ€™ve seen before, trees make use of a _hierarchical_ relationship.

# Applications for Trees

# Traversing Non-sequential data

Because there is no linear ordering to the data, we need to devise more creative ways of traversing through a tree.
