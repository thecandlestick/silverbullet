## Reflexivity

#Definition A relation **R** on a set **A** is **reflexive** if and only if for all **x** in **A**, **x R x**
```latex
R\text{ is reflexive} \Leftrightarrow \forall x \in A, (x,x) \in R
```

Another way of wording this property is that in a _reflexive relation_, each element is related to itself.

To demonstrate that a relation is not _reflexive_, you must find an element of **A** that is not related to itself.
```latex
R\text{ is not reflexive} \Leftrightarrow \exists x \in A \text{ such that } (x,x) \notin R
```

#DiscussionQuestion Is the following relation on the set of integers _reflexive_?
```latex
xRy \Leftrightarrow x \times y \text{ is positive}
```

## Symmetry

#Definition A relation **R** on a set **A** is **symmetric** if and only if for all **x,y** in **A**, if **x R y** then **y R x**
```latex
R\text{ is symmetric} \Leftrightarrow \forall x,y \in A, (x,y) \in R \rightarrow (y,x) \in R
```

Another way of wording this property is that in a _symmetric relation_, if any one element is related to another, then the second element is also related to the first.

To demonstrate that a relation is not _symmetric_, you must find two elements of **A** that violate this.
```latex
R\text{ is not symmetric} \Leftrightarrow \exists x,y \in A \text{ such that }(x,y) \in R \land (y,x) \notin R
```

#Definition A relation **R** on a set **A** is **anti-symmetric** if and only if for all **x,y** in **A**, if **x R y** and **y R x** then **x = y**

Another way of wording this property is that the relation **R** has exactly zero _symmetric_ relationships

#DiscussionQuestion Is the following relation on the set of reals _anti-symmetric_?
```latex
xRy \Leftrightarrow x \leq y
```

## Transitivity

#Definition A relation **R** on a set **A** is **transitive** if and only if for all **x,y,z** in **A**, if **x R y** and **y R z** then **x R z**
```latex
R\text{ is transitive} \Leftrightarrow \forall x,y,z \in A, ((x,y) \in R) \land ((y,z) \in R) \rightarrow ((x,z) \in R)
```

Another way of wording this property is that in a _transitive relation_, If any one element is related to a second and that second element is related to a third, then the first element is also related to the third

To demonstrate that a relation is not _transitive_ you must find three elements of **A** that violate this
```latex
R\text{ is not transitive} \Leftrightarrow \exist x,y,z \in A \text{ such that }((x,y) \in R) \land ((y,z) \in R) \land ((x,z) \notin R)
```


#DiscussionQuestion Let **A = {0,1,2,3}** and 
**R = {(0,0),(0,1),(0,3),(1,0),(1,1),(2,2),(3,0),(3,3)}**
* Is **R** _reflexive_? yes
* Is **R** _symmetric_? yes
* Is **R** _transitive_? no

Let **R** be a relation on the set of reals such that
```latex
xRz \Leftrightarrow x \leq z
```
* Is **R** _reflexive_? yes
* Is **R** _symmetric_? no
* Is **R** _transitive_? yes


#KnowledgeCheck Let **A = {0,1,2,3}** and **S = {(0,0),(0,2),(0,3),(2,3)}**
* Is **S** _reflexive_? no
* Is **S** _symmetric_? no

### Transitive Closure

#Definition Let **R** be a relation on a set **A**, the **Transitive Closure** of **R** is the relation on **A** that satisfies the following:
```latex
R^t \text{ is transitive}\\
R \subseteq R^t\\
\text{If }S\text{ is any other transitive relation that contains }R\text{, then }R^t \subseteq S
```

Another way of wording this is that the _transitive closure_ is the relation with the minimum number of additional elements to convert **R** into a _transitive_ relation

#BoardQuestion
Let **A = {0,1,2,3}** and **R = {(0,1),(1,2),(2,3)}**
Graph the _transitive closure_ of **R**

# Equivalence Relations

#Definition Let **R** be a relation on a set **A**. **R** is an **equivalence relation** if and only if **R** is _reflexive, symmetric,_ and _transitive_

_example:_
Let **A** be a set with partition **{A_0, A_1, ..., A_n}** and let **R** be a relation on **A** such that:
```latex
xRy \Leftrightarrow \exists A_i \text{ such that }x,y \in A_i
```

This relation has a special name. It is the **relation induced by the partition** given.

If we let **A = {0,1,2,3,4}** and consider the partition **{{0,3,4},{1},{2}}**, then the _relation induced by the partition_ is 

**R = {(0,0), (0,3), (0,4), (1,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,3), (3,4), (4,0), (4,3), (4,4)}**

#DiscussionQuestion Is **R** an _equivalence relation_? Is this the same for all _relations induced by partitions_?

## Equivalence Classes

#Definition Suppose **R** is a relation on a set **A**. For each element **a** in **A**, the **equivalence class** of **a**, denoted [a], is the set of all elements **x** in **A** such that **x** is related to **a** by **R**  
```latex
[a] = \{x\in A\mid xRa\}
```

In general, a relation **R** has as many _equivalence classes_ as there are elements in **A**. Oftentimes, however, we are concerned only with the **distinct equivalence classes** of **R**. That is, all possible sets representing an _equivalence class_ but not tied to a particular element in **A**

_example:_
Let **A = {{1},{2},{3},{1,2},{1,3},{2,3},{1,2,3}}**
Define a relation **R** on **A** such that:
```latex
aRb \Leftrightarrow \text{least element in }a = \text{ least element in }b
```

Then **R = {({1},{1}), ({1},{1,2}), ({1,2},{1}), ({1},{1,3}), 
({1,3},{1}), ({1},{1,2,3}), ({1,2,3},{1}), ({1,2},{1,3}), 
({1,3},{1,2}), ({1,2},{1,2,3}), ({1,2,3},{1,2}), ({1,3},{1,2,3}), ({1,2,3},{1,3}),({2},{2}) ({2},{2,3}), ({2,3},{2}), ({3},{3})}**

List the following _equivalence classes_:
* [{1}] = {{1}, {1,2}, {1,3}, {1,2,3}} 
* [{2}] = {{2}, {2,3}}
* [{1}] = {{3}}

**what are the equivalence classes of the other elements?
what are the distinct equivalence classes?**
