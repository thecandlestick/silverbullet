## Getting started
The best way to get a good feel for what SilverBullet is to immediately start playing with it. Here are some things for you to try:

* Click on the page picker (book icon) icon at the top right, or hit `Cmd-k` (Mac) or `Ctrl-k` (Linux and Windows) to open the **page switcher**.
  * Type the name of a non-existent page to create it.
  * You _can_ create pages in folders (if you‚Äôre into that type of thing) simply by putting slashes (`/`) in the name (even on Windows), e.g. `My Folder/My Page`. Don‚Äôt worry about that folder existing, we‚Äôll automatically create it if it doesn‚Äôt.
* Click on the terminal icon (top right), hit `Cmd-/` (Mac) or `Ctrl-/` (Linux and Windows), or tap the screen with 3 fingers at the same time (on mobile) to open the **command palette**. The {[Stats: Show]} one is a safe one to try.
* Select some text and hit `Alt-m` to ==highlight== it, or `Cmd-b` (Mac) or `Ctrl-b` (Windows/Linux) to make it **bold**, or `Cmd-i` (Mac) or `Ctrl-i` (Windows/Linux) to make it _italic_.
* Click a link somewhere on this page to navigate there. When you link to a new page it will initially show up in red (to indicate it does not yet exist), but once you click it ‚Äî¬†you will create the page automatically (only for real when you actually enter some text).
* Start typing `[[` somewhere to insert your own page link (with completion).
* [ ] Tap this box üëà to mark this task as done.
* Start typing `:party` to trigger the emoji picker üéâ
* Type `/` somewhere in the text to invoke a **slash command**.
* Hit `Cmd-p` (Mac) or `Ctrl-p` (Windows, Linux) to show a preview for the current page on the side.
* If this is matching your personality type, you can click this button {[Editor: Toggle Vim Mode]} to toggle Vim mode. If you cannot figure out how to exit it, just click that button again. _Phew!_

Notice that as you move your cursor around on this page and you get close to or ‚Äúinside‚Äù marked up text, you will get to see the underlying [[Markdown]] code. This experience is what we refer to as ‚Äúlive preview‚Äù ‚Äî¬†generally your text looks clean, but you still can see what‚Äôs under the covers and edit it directly, as opposed to [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) that some other applications use. To move your cursor somewhere using your mouse without navigating or activating (e.g. a wiki, regular link, or a button) hold `Alt` when you click. Holding `Cmd` or `Ctrl` when clicking a link will open it in a new tab or window.

Hadn‚Äôt we mentioned [[Markdown]] yet? Yeah, that‚Äôs the markup language you‚Äôll use to add that dash of markup to your documents. It‚Äôs pretty simple to learn if you don‚Äôt know it already.

You will notice this whole page section is wrapped in a strange type of block. This is a SilverBullet specific feature called a [[Live Templates]], which embeds another (sometime external) page into the existing one. If you hover over this section, you‚Äôll notice a small _refresh_ and _edit_ button. Hit that edit button to reveal the underlying source that renders this content.

SilverBullet has even more tricks up its sleeve. Consider [[Live Queries]] which allow you to query [[Objects]] in your space easily.

Don‚Äôt believe me? Check this out, here‚Äôs a list of (max 10) pages in your space ordered by name, it updates (somewhat) dynamically ü§Ø. Create some new pages and come back here to see that it works:

```query
page select name order by name limit 10 
```

Beyond that, you can find more information about SilverBullet on its official website. You have two ways to access it:

1. Through its [regular website link](https://silverbullet.md/)
2. Directly without leaving SilverBullet, through [[Federation]], just click on this: [[SilverBullet]] (note that all of these will be read-only, for obvious reasons)

To keep up with the latest and greatest going-ons in SilverBullet land, keep an eye on the [[CHANGELOG]], and regularly update your SilverBullet instance (`silverbullet upgrade` if you‚Äôre running the Deno version). If you run into any issues or have ideas on how to make SilverBullet even awesomer (yes, that‚Äôs a word), [join the conversation on GitHub](https://github.com/silverbulletmd/silverbullet).
