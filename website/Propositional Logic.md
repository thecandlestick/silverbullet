# Propositional Logic

#Definition A **proposition** (or **statement**) is a sentence that is either _true_ or _false_ but not both

For example:
* **2 + 2 = 5**  despite being _false_, is still a _proposition_
* **x / 2 > 0**  could be _true_ or _false_ depending on x, so it is not a _proposition_

To express more complex ideas, these propositions can be combined into **compound propositions**

Types of compound propositions:
* **Conjunction:** p ^ q, where p and q are propositions
  * Read as “p and q”
  * Both p and q must be true for p ^ q to be true
    
* **Disjunction:** p v q, where p and q are propositions
  * Read as “p or q”
  * Either p or q must be true for p v q to be true
  * _Example:_ “

Propositions can also be **negated** using the symbols ~, ¬, or !

When working with compound propositions,

## Truth Tables

The **truth table** for a given _statement form_ displays the truth values that correspond to all possible combinations of truth values for its compound statement variables
