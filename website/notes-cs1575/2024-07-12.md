# The Map Abstract Data Type

A Map is an _unordered collection(set)_ of pairs. Each pair consists of a **key** and a **value**. 

{ <key1, val1>, <key2, val2>, ... , <keyn, valn> }

Keys in a Map must be _unique_ so that no two pairs have the same _key_, but there is no such restriction on _values_.

## Operations

- getValue(M, key) -> the value paired with _key_, if _key_ is in M
- setValue(M, key, value) -> M’ with updated pair _<key, value>_
- insert(M, key, value) ->  M’ with new pair _<key, value>_
- erase(M, key) -> M’ without pair identified by _key_
- find(M, key) -> true if _key_ in M, false otherwise


The motivation behind the Map is that unlike the List we do not need to maintain the order of the data. This allows us to strategically structure the data to optimize our operations as much as possible. This ADT also commonly goes by the name of _Dictionary_

# Map Data Structures

## C++ standard library implementations:
* [std::map](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map)
* [std::unordered_map](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/unordered_map)

## Our Implementations:

[[TreeMap]] - Memory-efficient implementation based on [[BST]]

[[HashMap]] - Time-efficient implementation based on associative arrays

## Find

We start with _find_. We don’t directly know where everything is in a BST, so we may need this operation for other tasks as well
