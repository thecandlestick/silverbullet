# The List Abstract Data Type

A List is a _sequence_ of elements of the same type

## Operations

We shall define the following operations for the List A.D.T.:

_Let L = < a, o, e, u, i >_
* Size(L) -> The number of elements in L
* Get(L, i) -> The element of L at position i
* Set(L, i, x) -> L’ with element i set to x
* insert(L, i, x) -> L’ with new element at position i
* remove(L, i) -> L’ with element i removed 
* find(L, x) -> _true_ if x is in L, _false_ otherwise

Remember that an A.D.T. is a theoretical concept that has **nothing to do with C++ code**. Any structure, regardless of how it works or how it’s built, can be considered an implementation of a List as long as it can perform the above operations.
