# Recursion and Data Structures

Some data structures are purposefully designed with recursion in mind, or just so happen to store data using a recursive structure.

There is a particularly deep body of data structures that use [[Trees]] to represent data, which are inherently recursive objects and thus lend themselves well to operations implemented by recursive algorithms.

We have already seen an example of a recursive data structure; however, when we noted that the _ListNode_ class alone is sufficient to implement the _List_ abstract data type. To think of these operations recursively, simply note that the _next_ pointer for each node in this implementation points to either:
  * nullptr (**Base Case**)
  * a smaller (size n-1) list (**Recursive Case**)


As an exercise, how might you write a recursive version of the _Find_ or _Size_ operations for this particular list implementation?

# The Efficiency of Recursion

We’ve seen how recursion is a powerful tool for helping us think about problems differently and create elegant solutions, but how does it relate to the efficiency of our programs?

## When Recursion goes wrong

A classic example of recursion is that of the _Fibonacci Sequence_

  _1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ..._

Where the i-th Fibonacci number is the sum of the two previous, with the exception that the first and second numbers are _1, 1_

This is so often to introduce recursion to programmers because it’s so simple. The i-th Fibonacci number is so clearly recursively defined that the algorithm practically writes itself!

```c++
int fib(int i) // return the i-th Fibonacci number
{
  if (i == 1 || i == 2) // Base Cases
    return 1;

  return fib(i-1) + fib(i-2); // Recursive Case
}
```

However, those programmers (hopefully) then come to learn that this algorithm is horribly inefficient and are taught a much better iterative algorithm to use instead.

```c++
int better_fib(int i) // return the i-th Fibonacci number
{
  int fib_i_minus_one = 1
  int fib_i_minus_two = 1 // setting up the sequence
  
  int fib_i = 1;
  for(int k = 2; k < i; k++)
  {
    // calculate next-in-sequence
    fib_i = fib_i_minus_one + fib_i_minus_two
    
    // Prepare for next iteration
    fib_i_minus_two = fib_i_minus_one;
    fib_i_minus_one = fib_i;
  }
}
```


So what gives? Why is something so quintessentially recursive in nature such a bad candidate for a recursive algorithm?
* **Are all recursive algorithms _horribly inefficient_?** (no)
* **Should we always try to use iteration instead?** (not necessarily)
* **Is recursion _scary_?** (not if you understand where fib() goes wrong)

What you need to avoid in a recursive algorithm is _redundant sub-problems_. Taking a _top-down_ approach (starting at fib(i) and working towards the base case of fib(1) or fib(2)) causes you to re-compute a lot of information that you already know.

fib(6) makes a call to fib(5), then a call to fib(4). However, the 4th Fibonacci number was already calculated in the call to fib(5)! 

![](../img%2Ffib.png)
This wasteful re-calculation very quickly gets out of hand, and it’s why a _bottom-up_ approach like the iterative algorithm is the correct choice.

## Recursion is looping, looping is Recursion

It may not come as a surprise that iteration and recursion are often two sides of the same coin. After all, loops in C++ can be thought of as shorthand for recursive functions.

```c++
// Generic For-Loop
for( init ; test ; advance )
{
  body
}

// Recursive Equivalent
void loop(i)
{
  if (test(i) == false)
    return

  body(i)
  loop(advance(i))
}
```

```c++
// Generic While-Loop
while (test)
{
  body
}

// Recursive Equivalent
void loop()
{
  if (test == false)
    return

  body
  loop()
}
```

This is not actually how looping works in C++, but you can see how they are logically equivalent for solving problems. That is why simple recursive algorithms are often interchangeable with their iterative counterparts.

However, for more some recursive algorithms there is not always an obvious iterative equivalent. In these instances, if we want a non-recursive algorithm that behaves the same we need to _simulate_ recursion by replacing the _call stack_ with a stack of our own.

```c++
int fake_recursive_factorial(int n)
{
  vector<int> stack;
  int result = 1;

  // simulating recursive calls
  while(n > 1)
  {
    stack.push_back(n);
    n--;
  }
  
  // simulating those functions returning
  while(!stack.empty())
  {
    result *= stack.back();
    stack.pop_back();
  }

  return result;
}
```

This is a sometimes helpful optimization to make when the amount of information passed between recursive calls is relatively small and is often employed for tree/graph _traversals_.

# Recursive Backtracking

Another interesting use for recursion is for solving multi-step problems via systematically _guessing_ the right answer (from among all valid moves) for each step and _backtracking_ to a previous step when it becomes clear that a mistake has been made. While this approach is not always the most efficient approach, it is still a clever improvement over blindly _brute-forcing_ a solution as it can allow us to avoid testing combinations of steps that we know won’t lead to the solution.

It relates to the classic problem-solving technique _Trial-and-Error_ and can be applied to puzzles, mazes, decision-making games, and more! A classic example of a game where recursive backtracking is applied is the _n-Queens_ problem.

The **N-Queens problem** is as follows:
  _Given a n-by-n chessboard, place n queen pieces such that no two queens can attack each other_

Pseudocode for the _n-Queens_ problem:
```c++
// n is the size of the board (n-by-n)
// current_row keeps track of which row we are working with
// (each function call attempts to place 1 queen on current_row)
bool nQueens(int current_row, int n)
{
  // Consider all columns 0 through (n-1)
  for (int column = 0; column < n; column++) 
  {
    if (is_valid_move(column)) // Attempt any move which is valid
    {
      place_queen(current_row, column);
      if (current_row == n-1) // If all queens have been placed
        return true // Success!

      // Use a recursive call to solve the rest of the board
      bool solution_found = nQueens(current_row+1,n);
      if (solution_found)
        return true; // A recursive call found the solution
      else
        remove_queen(current_row) // Backtrack to other valid options
    }
  }
  return false; // No column placements resulted in `true`
}
```


Try to follow the algorithm yourself [here](http://eightqueen.becher-sundstroem.de/). Visualize each row as it’s own recursive function call and picture the call stack as you go.

**General recursive backtracking blueprint**

```c++
bool solve()
{

  if finished // check base case
    return true // success!
  
  possible_moves = {move1, move2, ..., moveN}

  for move in possible_moves // exhaust all valid options
  {
    if valid(move)
    {
      select(move)
      found_solution = solve() // continue to next step
      if found_solution
        return true // future moves were successful!
      else
        undo(move) // current move led to dead end ☠️
     }
   } 

  // If here, no moves were valid/successful
  return false; // dead end
    
}
```
