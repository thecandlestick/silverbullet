# Operations (member functions)

## Erase

Erasing an element from a BST while maintaining the search property can be a challenging task. We will need to come up with three separate plans for removing nodes of degree 0, 1, and 2.

Erasing a leaf node:

  delete `root`, set `root` to nullptr

* [ ] Brileigh  ðŸ“…2024-07-16 #cs1575EC

Erasing a node with 1 child:

  The child will replace the node to be removed in the tree structure

Erasing a node with 2 children:

  the node to be removed will be replaced by either:
    * The left-most node of the right subtree
    * The right-most node of the left subtree

* [ ] Brileigh  ðŸ“…2024-07-16 #cs1575EC

  Make a recursive call to remove the duplicate key
