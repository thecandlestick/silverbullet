Standard semester length: ~4 months

_Why_ does the vast majority of knowledge never make it to long-term memory?

Are instructors incentivized to focus on short-term “cramming?” Can we truly assess the metric of long-term knowledge retention?

Computer science approach: Computer memory is (also) a limited resource. Caching is used to preserve important knowledge for future use based on recent needs

**Repetition is Key**

repetition is necessary for retention. The scientific explanation: 

_Returning to a new memory reactivates the pathways connecting those neurons. As pathways are reactivated, the brain begins to wrap a sheath of insulation (called myelin) around them. Much like
insulation around an electrical wire that helps electrical charges move more quickly, the myelin coating makes it easier for those neurons to fire together again_

#quote Students must rehearse a new skill at least 24 times before they reach 80 percent competency (Anderson, 1995)


**Spaced repetition strengthens memory**

best to space repetitions over a period of days or weeks

Avoid the “illusion of knowing” created by short-term cramming

**Interleaved practice is initially more difficult, but ultimately more effective**

3 ft beanbag toss vs 2/4 ft toss

block vs interleaved geometry students. 100/70 day one, 40/80 day two. Fewer “discrimination errors” in the interleaved group

“desirable difficulties”

## Retrieval Practice (“Quizzing to Remember”)

tendency to use quizzes to measure rather than support learning

Shows very positive empirical results for “retain and recall” tasks. Suggests this strategy is most effective for building foundational knowledge rather than complex critical thinking tasks

**Demonstrably better than most other forms of studying**
  * reviewing test Q&A
  * rereading texts
  * constructing concept maps

**Works best with timely feedback**

A brief delay between question and correct answer fosters curiosity in students. Having to wait a day or more for feedback kills that opportunity

#DiscussionQuestion How to create opportunities without eating a ton of class time? Can students be expected to abstain from using notes/etc outside of the classroom?

**timed retrieval practice supports basic fluency**

Putting a time limit / speed component to this strategy does not seem to help build complex skills

**should support initial mastery then be spaced**

students engaged in full practice sessions regardless of mastery outperform students who selectively focus on unfamiliar/unmastered concepts

### Classroom Tips

* Quiz more grade less
  * #DiscussionQuestion Students practice independently and consistently for music or sports, but commonly save quizzes and studying for the last minute. Why is this?
* Give _immediate_ feedback if possible
* Speeded practice for basic skills, reflective practice for complex skills

## Spaced, Mixed, Independent Practice

Must break out of the “teach once, practice once, test once” cadence of learning
