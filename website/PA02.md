_Weary William the Workful_
# CS1575 ArrayList Assignment

![](img/workful-willy.png)

**Problem:**
William is down on his luck and needs money, lest he be evicted from his residence by his landlord. Luckily for William, there seems to be many jobs available nearby and no sense of scarcity on his energy. 

William has a rapidly changing schedule for his jobs that will be required to be stored in an ArrayList. At the start of every day, an event may occur. Your task will be to deal with the event and how it will affect William’s schedule using MyVector.hpp and main.cpp.

MyVector.hpp should be modified to replicate the functionality of std::vector as closely as possible (you can use cppreference if you want additional information on how std::vector works). Function definitions and information on how you should actually implement your ArrayList functionality in this assignment can be found in MyVector.h (do NOT modify this file.) It is recommended to use the unit tests as a guide and program each function one-by-one after passing each test.

main.cpp should be modified to interpret and react to input using your built ArrayList. Your program should then give an output depending on the input, more information on this below.

**Input:**

Input will be a stream of lines that will give specific information about an event for William and how it will affect his schedule. 
The first line of input will be a list of jobs that William will start his schedule with. **William will always start with 3 jobs**. The positions of the job in the list should match the position in William’s schedule, for example the first job that appears in input should be at index 0 in William’s schedule. 

The second line will the number of days William has until eviction.

The rest of the lines of input will be events that affect William’s schedule. There will be one event for every day until eviction, and they will follow this format:

---

ADD **job** **timeslot** 
William gets a new job and adds it to his schedule. 
**timeslot** is an integer relating to the position within William’s schedule arraylist, and **job** is a string beginning and ending with quotation marks.  For ADD specifically, the range of **timeslot** is from 0 to the amount of elements in William’s schedule, inclusively. **timeslot** for FIRE and CAR_CRASH have a range from 0 to the amount of element’s in William’s schedule minus 1, inclusively.

---

FIRE (**job**) 
William gets fired from one of his jobs. 
All instances of that job should be removed from William’s schedule.

---

SLEPT_IN **time** 
William accidentally sleeps in one morning and gets fired from the jobs he missed.
**time** is an integer relating to how many shifts William slept through. All slept through shifts should be removed from William’s schedule. Removed shifts should start at index 0, going upwards.

---

CAR_CRASH **timeslot**
William crashes his car and can’t make it to any jobs in his schedule for the rest of the day.
**timeslot** is the position in William’s schedule where he crashes his car. Everything at and after the car crash should be removed from William’s schedule, e.g. CAR_CRASH 0 would remove everything from William’s schedule.

---

DISEASE
William gets struck down with a terrible illness and can’t make it to work at all today.
Remove everything in William’s schedule.

---

**Example input:**

```
Dentist Garbageman Lawyer
13
ADD Janitor 1
FIRE Dentist
FIRE Lawyer
ADD Cheesemonger 0
SLEPT_IN 2
ADD Pilot 1
ADD Baker 1
CAR_CRASH 2
DISEASE
ADD Coal-Miner 0
ADD Magician 0
ADD Fireman 1
FIRE Magician
```

**Output:**
After each event, print William’s current schedule for the day on its own line. If an event leaves William with nothing in his schedule, print the word _Unemployed_. You do not need to print William’s initial schedule

Example output:

```
Dentist Janitor Garbageman Lawyer
Janitor Garbageman Lawyer
Janitor Garbageman
Cheesemonger Janitor Garbageman
Garbageman
Garbageman Pilot
Garbageman Baker Pilot
Garbageman Baker
Unemployed
Coal-Miner
Magician Coal-Miner
Magician Fireman Coal-Miner
Fireman Coal-Miner
```

**Important Notes:**
To bring this implementation more in line with std::vector and prepare you for working with the standard library implementations directly, some functions have shifted to use an **ArrayListIterator** in place of an _integer_ index. 

The **ArrayListIterator** class provided is designed to act exactly like a normal integer.
* It can be used wherever your code expects an integer **(operator int() implicit conversion)**
* It can be incremented / summed with other integers **(operator+)**
* It can be compared to other integers **(operator> / operator<)**

Unit tests are useful and we try to make sure they catch as many faults as possible, but we can’t often test every single edge case. This may lead to the unfortunate outcome where even though you’re passing all unit tests, your code isn’t 100% correct and you run into something when testing the stdio tests.
