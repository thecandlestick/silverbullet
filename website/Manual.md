Welcome to wonderful world of SilverBullet. The goal of this manual is to give you a broad sense of how to use this tool and what it’s capable of. However, its full capabilities are yet to be discovered. Every day, people find new and creative ways to use the various SilverBullet features in ways nobody previously thought of. Perhaps you will be one of those people.

However, that is unlikely to happen unless you understand some of the basics. So let’s start there.
