# Counting Unions & Intersections of Sets

Getting the exact number of elements in a union of sets can be tricky. After all, the sets might in general share some elements or they might not

#Theorem For finite sets **A and B**:
```latex
|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|
```

Intuitively, this means that the number of elements in **A U B** is equal to the number of elements in **A** plus the number of elements in **B** minus the number of elements that they share.

#DiscussionQuestion Using the theorem above, how many integers from 1 to 1000 are multiples of 3 or 5?

**A union B** = |A| + |B| - |A intersect B| = 333 + 200 - 66 = **467**

3(1), 3(2), 3(3), ..., 3(333) = **A**
5(1), 5(2), 5(3), ..., 5(200) = **B**
15(1), 15(2), 15(3), ..., 15(66) = **A intersect B**

#DiscussionQuestion Given the following information:
  * How many students are currently enrolled in CS 1570? **2**
  * How many students are currently enrolled in MATH 1215? **1**
  * How many students are enrolled in _either_ course? **3**
Use the theorem above to calculate the number of students enrolled in _both_ courses

## The Pigeonhole Principle

The _Pigeonhole Principle_ states that if **n** pigeons fly into **m** pigeonholes to roost, where **n > m**, then at least one pigeonhole contains more than one pigeon

![](../img/TooManyPigeons.jpg)

This is fairly intuitive, but nonetheless serves as an important foundation for many higher level mathematical results

#Theorem (_The Pigeonhole Principle_) A function from set **A** to set **B**, **f: A -> B**, where **|A| > |B|**, can never be _one-to-one / injective_ 

_examples:_

* What size group of people is needed to _guarantee_ at least two people share a birth month?

**let f: P->M** be defined as **f(p) = p‚Äôs birth month, m**
if |P| > |M|, then **f** is not one-to-one

|P| > 12
|P| = 13 people

* In a drawer containing 5 red socks and 5 black socks, how many socks must be drawn to _guarantee_ a matching pair? How many to guarantee a pair of black socks?

**3**
**7**
  
* If 5 integers are selected from **{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}**, is it _guaranteed_ that at least one pair will have a sum of **9**?

P = {(1,8),(2,7),(3,6),(4,5)}

**f: {1-8} -> P** := f(x) = the pair in P x belongs to

#Theorem (_Generalized Pigeonhole Principle_) Given any function **f** from a finite set **X** with **n** elements to a finite set **Y** with **m** elements,
```latex
\forall k \in \Z^+, \text{If }k < \frac{n}{m} \text{ then }\exists y \in Y\\ \text{ such that }y\text{ is the image of at least k+1 distinct elements of }X
```

The _contrapositive_ form of this theorem is then
```latex
\forall k \in Z^+, \text{ If } y \text{ is the image of at most }k \text{ distinct elements of X, then } n < km
```


_example:_ **Sharing Computers**

**42** students are sharing **12** computers.  Prove that there is a computer being used by **3** or more students

_consider the students as pigeons and the computers as pigeonholes_

**S** - The set of students
**C** - The set of computers

**f : S -> C** is a function mapping each student to the computer they are using

**S** has **n = 42** elements and **C** has **m = 12** elements, so the _generalized pigeonhole principle_ applies to **f**

Let **k = 2**, then the proposition:
```latex
\exists y \in C \text{ such that }y \text{ is the image of at least k+1 distinct elements of S}
```
means that there exists a computer ‚Äú**c**‚Äú and students ‚Äú**s1, s2, s3‚Äù** such that
* **f(s1) = c**
* **f(s2) = c**
* **f(s3) = c**

In other words, there is a computer being shared by **3** students.

The _generalized pigeonhole principle_ states that this is true if:
```latex
k < \frac{n}{m} \leftrightarrow 2 < \frac{42}{12} = 3.75\\
```

Therefore, a computer is being used by at least 3 students

_example:_ **shared initials**

Out of a group of **85** people, is it always the case that at least **4** people share a first initial?

Let‚Äôs consider a proof by contradiction:

Suppose not, that no **4** people out of **85** have the same first initial. Then at most **3** people can share any particular letter as their initial

If we consider the following function:

**P** - set of people (**n = 85**)
**I** - set of initials (**m = 26**)
**f: P -> I** maps a person to their first initial

Then the _contrapositive_ form of the _generalized pigeonhole principle_ (where _y_ is the image of at most _k = 3_ elements of **P**) tells us that **n** (the number of elements in **P**) must be less than **km = 3x26 = 78**.

This is a contradiction, as we originally stated there were **85** people in **P** which is not less than **78**

Therefore, our supposition was false. That is, at least **4** people in **85** share a first initial.

#Theorem For finite sets **A,B,C**:
```latex
|A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |B \cap C| - |A \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C| 
```

#DiscussionQuestion How can we interpret the theorem above? Try using a Venn diagram to visualize the result and gain a better intuition
