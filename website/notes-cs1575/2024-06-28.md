# Intro to Algorithm Complexity


## Complexity & Data Structures

For the following comparison, assume that both lists accept a ListIterator to access data with operations:
* prev() - move to previous data element
* next() - move to next data element
* moveTo(i) - move to element i

For get, insert, erase, assume that you have a valid ListIterator

| Operation | ArrayList | LinkedList |
|----------|----------|----------|
| get | O(1) | O(1) |
| prev | O(1) | O(n) |
| next | O(1) | O(1) |
| moveTo | O(1) | O(n) |
| insert | O(n) | O(1) |
| erase | O(n) | O(1) |

What conclusions can you draw about which list to use?

_KC:
Fill in the table above for a Doubly-LinkedList. A Doubly-LinkedList uses nodes that store the memory address of the next and the previous node_


In this section weâ€™ll see how some limited, minimal data structures can still be a powerful tool. Weâ€™ll also see how having fewer operations can lead to enhanced performance through clever engineering

# Stacks

## The Abstract Data Type Stack

A stack is a _sequence_ of elements of the same type

One end of the sequence is designated the _top_. A stack follows a strategy of _first-in, last-out_ (FILO) where the newest data in the sequence is always the first to be removed.

### Operations:

_Let S1 =  **top ->** < a, o, e, u, i >_
* top(S) -> the top element of S
  * top(S1) -> a
    
* push(S, x) -> Sâ€™ with new top element, x
  * push(S1, y) -> <y, a, o, e, u , i>
    
* pop(S) -> Sâ€™ with top element removed
  * pop(S1) -> <o, e, u, i >
