## Negating Propositions

#Theorem **DeMorgan‚Äôs Laws**: The negation of a _conjunction_ is logically equivalent to the corresponding _disjunction_ in which each component is negated. The negation of a _disjunction_ is logically equivalent to the corresponding _conjunction_ in which each component is negated.

This theorem tells us that **~(p v q)** is logically equivalent to **~p ^ ~q**
and **~(p ^ q)** is logically equivalent to **~p v ~q**.

We can confirm both of these results using a truth table:

| p | q | p v q | ~(p v q) | ~p ^ ~q |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| T | T | T | F | F |
| T | F | T | F | F |
| F | T | T | F | F |
| F | F | F | T | T |

Therefore, **~(p v q)** ‚â° **~p ^ ~q**

| p | q | p ^ q | ~(p ^ q) | ~p v ~q |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| T | T | T | F | F |
| T | F | F | T | T |
| F | T | F | T | T |
| F | F | F | T | T |

Therefore, **~(p ^ q)** ‚â° **~p v ~q**

Sometimes it becomes necessary to apply DeMorgan‚Äôs laws multiple times during a negation as in the example below

#BoardQuestion Using DeMorgan‚Äôs law, negate the statement form:        **(~p ^ q) ^ (p v q)**

~(w ^ u) = ~w v ~u

(p v ~q) v (~p ^ ~q)

### Negating conditional statements

Recall that a conditional statement **p -> q** is _false_ if and only if p is _true_ and q is _false_. The negation **~(p -> q)** should therefore be _true_ if and only if p is _true_ and q is _false_. A statement form with this property can be written as **p ^ ~q**

and confirmed with a truth table:

| p | q | p -> q | ~(p -> q) | p ^ ~q |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| T | T | T | F | F |
| T | F | F | T | T |
| F | T | T | F | F |
| F | F | T | F | F |

Therefore, **~(p -> q)** ‚â° **p ^ ~q**

# Predicates

#Definition A **predicate** is a sentence that contains a finite number of variables and becomes a _proposition_ when specific values are substituted for the variables

_example:_ **2x > x** is not a _proposition_, but it is a _predicate_

#Definition The **domain** of a predicate variable is the set of all values that may be substituted in place of the variable

_examples:_ 
```latex
\Z , \R , \N , \Complex , \Z^- , (0,1) , \R / \{ 42 \} , ...
```

#Definition The **truth set** of a _predicate_ **P(x)** with _domain_ **D** is the set of all elements of D that make P(x) a true statement when substituted for x

In set-builder notation, this is denoted:
```latex
\{x \in D | P(x) \}
```

_example:_
```latex
\{ x \in \Z^+ | \frac{10}{x} > 1 \}
```
represents the set
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}


## Comparing Truth Sets

Let **P(x)** and **Q(x)** be predicates with domain **D**

The notation
```latex
P(x) \Rightarrow Q(x)
```
is a _proposition_ that means every element in the _truth set_ of **P(x)** is also in the _truth set_ of **Q(x)**. This can also be written as:
```latex
\forall x \in D, P(x) \rightarrow Q(x)\\
\text{or}\\
\{x \in D | P(x)\} \subseteq \{x \in D | Q(x)\}
```

The notation
```latex
P(x) \Leftrightarrow Q(x)
```
is a _proposition_ that the _truth set_ of **P(x)** is exactly equal to the _truth set_ of **Q(x)**. This can also be written as:
```latex
\forall x \in D, P(x) \leftrightarrow Q(x)\\
\text{or}\\
P(x) \Rightarrow Q(x) \land Q(x) \Rightarrow P(x)
```

#BoardQuestion Compare the _truth sets_ of the following _predicates_. Let the _domain_ be the set of all positive integers for each.
* Q(n) = ‚Äún is a factor of 8‚Äù **{1, 2, 4, 8}**
* R(n) = ‚Äún is a factor of 4‚Äù **{1, 2, 4}**
* S(n) = ‚Äún < 5 and n is not 3‚Äù **{1, 2, 4}**

#KnowledgeCheck Let **P(x)** = ‚Äúx < 1‚Äù and Let **Q(x)** = ‚Äúx > x^2‚Äù
Using the domain **D** = {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2} , is the following _proposition_ true or false?
```latex
P(x) \Leftrightarrow Q(x) 
```
_hint: construct the truth sets if you‚Äôre unsure_

**P(X) - {-2, -1, 0}**
**Q(X) - {}**

# Quantified Statements

A **Quantified Statement** is a _proposition_ that makes a logical claim about a _quantity_ of elements in the domain of a _predicate_ using terms such as ‚Äúall‚Äù, ‚Äúevery‚Äù, ‚Äúsome‚Äù, or ‚Äúat least one‚Äù

## Universal Statements

_note: the symbol ‚àÄ is read as ‚Äúfor all‚Äù_

#Definition a **universal statement** is a proposition with the form:
```latex
\forall x \in D, Q(x)
```
where **Q(x)** is a _predicate_ and **D** is the _domain_ of **x**

A _universal statement_ is defined to be _true_ if and only if **Q(x)** is true for _every_ value of **x** in **D**

A _universal statement_ is _false_ if and only if **Q(x)** is false for _at least one_ value of **x** in **D**. This is known as a **counterexample**

_example:_ If D is the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, then
```latex
\forall x \in D, x^2 \geq x
```
is a _universal statement_
