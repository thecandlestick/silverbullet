#Quote _Mathematical induction is the standard proof technique in computer science
  -Anthony Ralston, 1984_


# Mathematical Induction

#Definition A **proof by induction** seeks to prove that a property **P(x)** holds for a (possibly infinite) sequence of elements by proving **P(x)** must hold for consecutive elements in the domain

Let **P(n)** be a property or predicate that is defined for integers **n**, and let **a** be a fixed integer

Now consider the following (valid) argument:
```latex
\forall k \geq a, P(k) \rightarrow P(k+1)\\
P(a)\\
\therefore \forall n \geq a, P(n)
```

The principle being applied here is similar to a (possibly infinite) chain of dominoes. **P(a)** is proven true directly, and by the major premise provides proof that **P(a+1)** is true, which provides proof that **P(a+2)** is true, which provides proof that **P(a+3)** is true, ...

_A proof by induction is structured as follows:_

1. **Define your property P(x)**, The statement to be proved should be of the form: **“For all integers n >= a, P(n) is true”**
   
2. **Basis Step:** Prove that **P(a)** is _true_

3. **Inductive Step:** Prove that for all integers **k >= a**, if **P(k)** is true then **P(k+1)** must be true as well
  * **State the inductive hypothesis**: Suppose **P(k)** is true, where **k** is any particular but arbitrarily chosen integer with **k >= a**
  * **Show P(k+1) is true** using only the _inductive hypothesis_, definitions, and known rules of logical inference

4. Conclude the original statement is true, **for all integers n >= a, P(n) is true**


#BoardQuestion Use a proof by induction for the following statement:
```latex
\forall n \geq 1, \sum_{i=1}^ni = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
```

1.
P(n) := Sum(i = 1 -> n) i = n(n+1)/2

2.
P(1) := Sum(i = 1 -> 1) i = 1(1+1)/2

1 = 2/2
P(1) is true

* [ ] drake, edward  📅2024-06-24 #cs1200EC

3. 
**inductive hypothesis:** suppose k is an integer such that k >= 1 and P(k) is true.

If P(k) is true, then Sum(i = 1 -> k) i = k(k+1)/2

**prove that:** P(k+1) is true <-> Sum(i = 1 -> k+1) i = ((k+1)(k+2))/2

LHS = sum(i=1 -> k+1) i = sum{i=1 -> k}( i ) + (k+1)
**by I.H.** LHS = k(k+1)/2 + (k+1) = k(k+1)/2 + 2(k+1)/2 
= (k(k+1) + 2(k+1))/2
**factor out** (k+1)
LHS = ((k+1)(k+2))/2 = RHS

4.
Therefore, by mathematical induction, P(n) is true for all n >= 1

## Induction Practice Problems

Prove the following using mathematical induction:

_The product of any three consecutive positive integers is divisible by 3_
* [ ] edward  📅2024-06-24 #cs1200EC

P(n) := 3|(n*(n+1)*(n+2))

3|(1*(1+1)*(1+2))
3|3(2)


```latex
\forall n \geq 2, x \geq 1 \in \Z, (1+x)^n > 1 + x^n
```

```latex
\forall n \geq 1 \in \Z, 1 + 6 + 11 + 16 + ... + (5n-4) = \frac{n(5n-3)}{2}
```
* [ ] brileigh  📅2024-06-24 #cs1200EC
P(n) := Sum{i =1 to n} (5n-4) = (n(5n-3))/2
P(1) := Sum{1 =1 to 1} (5(1)-4) = (1(5(1)-3))/2
= 2/2 = 1
P(1) is true
```latex
\forall n \geq 0 \in \Z, \sum_{i=1}^{n+1}i*2^i = n*2^{n+2}+2
```

```latex
\forall n \geq 0 \in \Z, n^3 - 7n + 3\text{ is divisible by 3}
```
* [ ] john  📅2024-06-24 #cs1200EC

P(n) := 3|n^3 -7n + 3 
3|3
P(0) is true
```latex
\forall n \geq 2 \in \Z, 5^n + 9 < 6^n
```
* [ ] drake  📅2024-06-24 #cs1200EC

P(n) := 5^n+9 < 6^n
5^2 + 9  < 6 ^2
25 + 9 < 36
34 < 36
P(2) is true
```latex
\forall n \geq 0 \in \Z, 2^n < (n+2)!
```
* [ ] joseph S.  📅2024-06-24 #cs1200EC

P(n) := 2^n < (n+2)!

 2^0 = 1.  (0+2)! = 2.  1 < 2.
 P(0) is ture

## Generalized Induction on Sequences

When introducing the process of a proof by induction, we said that the statement to be proved should be of the form: 
    **“For all integers n >= a, P(n) is true”**

More generally, induction can be used to prove statements of the form:
    **“For all integers n >= 0, P(a_n) is true”**
Where a_n is any sequence defined in terms of it’s index, n

In this case, the statement to be proven in the inductive step becomes:
    **“If P(a_n) is true, then P(a_{n+1}) must be true as well”**



## Strong Mathematical Induction

For particularly challenging proofs, the assumption that P(k) is true may not necessarily be enough to show that P(k+1) is true as well. The principle of **strong mathematical induction** changes the inductive step to be proved to:

```latex
P(a) \land P(a+1) \land ... \land P(k-1) \land P(k) \rightarrow P(k+1)
```
