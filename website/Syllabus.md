# Grading
The number and weighting of assignments is tentative and may change

Homework - 700 points
Weekly Quizzes - 240 points
Syllabus Quiz - 60 points
_Total: 1000 points_

## Assignments
There will be 8 total homework assignments, primarily C++ coding-based. Your lowest homework score will be dropped.

There is _no_ midterm exam and _no_ final exam

## Extra Credit
There will be daily opportunities for extra credit, all requiring attendance and participation at the lecture.

You may earn a maximum of 10 extra credit points per week, with no limit on daily or total amount earned. **Two or more unexcused absences during a week will forfeit any extra credit earned**, please email prior to class for exemptions.

The following actions are worth 2 points each:
* Answering a knowledge-check in class _(donâ€™t have to be correct)_
* Participating in a discussion question
* Correctly identifying a mistake with the course material
* Asking a high-quality question _(must be meaningful and further class understanding on a topic)_

Please stay in the zoom meeting after class to claim extra credit for the day.

## Autograder ([grade.sh](https://gitlab.com/classroomcode/grade-sh/grade-sh))
Your assignments in this course will be graded by an open-source autograding tool developed right here at S&T. Some exciting features include the ability to receive ==immediate feedback== on your current progress and built-in tools to help you incrementally develop your code.

# Policies

## Attendance
This course is online-synchronous, so regular attendance at the lectures is expected. I understand during the Summer session some students juggle work as well, so please contact me _in advance_ about schedule conflicts. Unexcused absences will drop your grade and exclude you from extra credit opportunities.

## Late Work
No late work will be accepted once the assignment repositories close. Because the summer session is only 8 weeks, there will be no time for resubmissions and make-ups so please keep up with assignments and do not expect extensions.

## Academic Honesty
All code submitted must be 100% your own work!
Do not copy code from the internet, fellow students, or Large Language Models. Submitted assignments **will** be checked for plagiarism at times throughout the semester, and any instances of academic dishonesty will result in a score of zero with further action depending on severity. 

## Coding Standards
In this course, we will use an automatic code formatting tool (clang-format) to ensure a consistent style. You are encouraged to write quality comments alongside your code, but will not be graded on your documentation / organization.
