# Intro to Algorithm Complexity

[[examples/runtime-logarithm]]

If you want to analyze other characteristics, you just need to come up with an equivalent function representation. For example, a function that maps size of input to bytes of memory needed to produce the output would allow you to analyze memory consumption (or _space complexity_)

## Comparing Rate-of-Growth

Now that we have a way of representing algorithms as programs, we need a way of comparing them. As relying on our intuition to decide which is function is _better_ can be misleading.

_ENHANCE!_

What we really value in algorithms is how well they _scale_ for large inputs. This due to a relatively simple law of algorithms: 
  
_For small inputs, the differences between Algo A and Algo B will generally be small as well. For large inputs the differences can be much greater, sometimes exponentially so!_
