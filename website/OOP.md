# Object Oriented Programming

OOP is a _programming paradigm_ centered around the idea of organizing your code through _objects_. Objects are a coupling of data and the code that is meant to act on that data. (variables + functions)

## The 3 Pillars of OOP

There are three (generally) agreed upon aspects OOP design

* [[Encapsulation]]
* [[Inheritance]]
* [[Polymorphism]]


Different programming languages will express these ideas in different ways. Some languages may support only some aspects of OOP design, and others may be incompatible with OOP entirely.
