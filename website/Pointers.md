# Memory Model

The programming in this course will have you directly manipulating _memory_. Before that, we first need to clarify what exactly we mean by _memory_. 

Your program, and any variables it creates, live in the memory of your computer. This memory is a limited resource. Use too much and the computer slows; use more than you have and the program crashes!

## Memory as a Tape

You can think of memory as a continuous tape of addressable _cells_

<>

Of course, not all datum fit neatly into a fixed-size _cell_, but this model is good enough to discuss what happens during code execution.

## Memory Diagrams

When writing programs, we rarely concern ourselves with the underlying particulars of memory. Those details are abstracted away in high level programming languages.

A more common way of representing the state of memory is using _memory diagrams_.
