# Grading

## Assignments
Homework will be primarily C++ coding-based, with the amount of assignments dependent on the speed of content covered. Your lowest homework score will be dropped.

Occasional _knowledge checks_ will be given in class through canvas. You will need to be present in class and have an internet-capable device to get the points

There is _no_ midterm exam and _no_ final exam

## Scale

The breakdown of your grade will be as follows:
* 85% Programming assignments
* 15% Canvas Quizzes (knowledge checks)



## Autograder ([grade.sh](https://gitlab.com/classroomcode/grade-sh/grade-sh))
Your assignments in this course will be graded by an open-source autograding tool developed right here at S&T. Some exciting features include the ability to receive ==immediate feedback== on your current progress and built-in tools to help you incrementally develop your code.

# Policies

## Attendance
You are expected to be present for all lectures. Make-ups for in-class assignments will only be considered if you notify me about your absence ahead of time.

## Late Work
Due to the transparency of grading in this class, and the availability of partial credit on all assignments, no late work will be accepted once the assignment repositories close. It is **highly recommended** that you start your assignments as early as possible. They are designed to be worked on one small unit at a time, with partial credit awarded accordingly.

## Academic Honesty
All code submitted must be 100% your own work!
Do not copy code from the internet, fellow students, or Large Language Models. Submitted assignments **will** be checked for plagiarism at times throughout the semester, and any instances of academic dishonesty will result in a score of zero with further action depending on severity. 

## Coding Standards
In this course, we will use an automatic code formatting tool (clang-format) to ensure a consistent style. You are encouraged to write quality comments alongside your code, but will not be graded on your documentation / organization.
