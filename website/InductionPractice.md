# Q1
//induction-1

_The sum of any 3 consecutive positive integers is divisible by 3_

# Q2
//induction-2

**Prove the following statement by induction:**

```latex
\text{For all integers }n \geq 1, 2+4+6+...+2n = n^2 + n
```



# Q3
//induction-3

**Prove the following statement by induction:**

```latex
2^n < (n+2)! \quad\text{  for all integers }n \geq 0 
```

# Q4
//induction-4

**Find and prove by induction a _closed-form_ expression for:**
```latex
\sum_{i=1}^n(2i-1)
```
That holds for all positive integers, _n_


# Q5
//induction-5

**Prove the following statement by induction:**

For all integers _n >= 2_
```latex
\prod_{i=2}^n(1-\frac{1}{i^2}) = \frac{n+1}{2n}
```


# Q6
//induction-6

**Prove the following statement by induction:**

```latex
n! > 2^n \quad\text{ for all integers }n \geq 4
```
