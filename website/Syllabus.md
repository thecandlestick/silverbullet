## Assignments
Homework will be primarily C++ coding-based, with the amount of assignments dependent on the speed of content covered. Your lowest homework score will be dropped.

Instead of large quizzes or exams, in-class assignments will be spread out to short, daily knowledge-checks. You will need to bring some form of internet-capable device to the lectures for this purpose.

There is _no_ midterm exam and _no_ final exam

## Extra Credit

There may be opportunities for extra credit at times throughout the semester, the majority of which will require in-person participation at lectures. These may take the form of discussion questions or small “pop-quizzes”

## Autograder ([grade.sh](https://gitlab.com/classroomcode/grade-sh/grade-sh))
Your assignments in this course will be graded by an open-source autograding tool developed right here at S&T. Some exciting features include the ability to receive ==immediate feedback== on your current progress and built-in tools to help you incrementally develop your code.

# Policies

## Attendance


## Late Work
No late work will be accepted once the assignment repositories close. It is **highly recommended** that you start your assignments as early as possible. They are designed to be worked on one small unit at a time, with partial credit awarded accordingly.

## Academic Honesty
All code submitted must be 100% your own work!
Do not copy code from the internet, fellow students, or Large Language Models. Submitted assignments **will** be checked for plagiarism at times throughout the semester, and any instances of academic dishonesty will result in a score of zero with further action depending on severity. 

## Coding Standards
In this course, we will use an automatic code formatting tool (clang-format) to ensure a consistent style. You are encouraged to write quality comments alongside your code, but will not be graded on your documentation / organization.
