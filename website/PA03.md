# LinkedList Implementation (forward_list)

## Assignment Description

It’s time for yet another family vacation, and that means a new travel plan! You have a simple tour of the golden fields and refreshing winds of Italy planned, but if the last family trip was any indication, then you’re in for plenty of unplanned stops and detours. 

![](img/italy.png)

You remember from last time that most of your changes to the travel plan affected the next stop instead of the final destination. Since your ArrayList-based travel planner is not very efficient at insertions/removals to the middle of the list, you’ve decided to rebuild it using a LinkedList.

Your task will be to replicate the functionality of a std::forward_list as closely as possible in your own class (MyList).

The class you’ll be building along with function definitions can be found in MyList.h, read this file carefully as the operations may not be exactly the same as those discussed in class. (**DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE**) You can also refer to [cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/forward_list) for more info on the operations.

Place your code for each of the required functions in MyList.hpp, as always it is recommended that you follow the unit tests as a guide and code each function one-by-one after passing each test.

**Important Note:**
To bring this implementation more in line with std::forward_list and prepare you for working with the standard library implementations directly, some functions have shifted to use an **LinkedListIterator** in place of a normal _pointer_.

The **LinkedListIterator** class provided is designed to act similar to a _ListNode_ pointer.
* It returns a reference to the underlying node when de-referenced
* It can be advanced forward _i_ nodes with addition **(iter+1 ; iter+i)**
* It can be used to access member variables **(iter->data ; iter->next)**

## Input

No input specification for this assignment. You can focus on writing your operations and nailing down those unit & memory tests!

## Scoring:

To get full points on the assignment...
* Implement each function in the _MyList_ class **(unit_tests)**
* Fix any memory leaks or invalid memory operations **(mem_tests)**
* Address any warnings given by cppcheck **(static analysis)**
* Format your code using the clang-format utility **(style check)**

# General information regarding this repository

## Coding
Tips for coding.

### What to name my files?
We give you empty files corresponding to those you should complete!

### Where to code?
We assume you're on a Linux machine, and can install all the software needed by this auto-grader.
See the syllabus for more details.

### How to get this code?
Find the blue button that says "clone", on the home page of this repository.
If you have an ssh key set up:
 `git clone git@... `
If you don't have an ssh set up, or know what that is:
 `git clone https://.. `

### Where to read this file?
This file is nicely displayed in the Gitlab web interface, but you can read it wherever.

### What to install?
See the script's warnings.

### How to code?
Using this script, we strongly encourage you to program incrementally. 
Program code required by the unit tests, in the requested order. 
In general, don't proceed to a later function if you are not passing the first one.
If you get stuck, instead of moving on, get help!
See the syllabus for extended coding tips.

## Auto-grader

### How to run the auto-grader on your machine?
Run the following in the root directory of your repository:
 `./grade.sh `

## How to run the auto-grader on Gitlab-CI?
Make sure all your files are added, committed, and pushed to the appropriate branch (see Git section below).
Navigate to the Gitlab web interface to confirm these changes exist on the server.

## How to make sure I'm getting points?
 * Click on CI/CD -> Jobs -> the latest job.
 * Is it passing, green, etc? 
 * What grade does it say you have?
 * Whatever grade the latest job says, is what we think you have!

## std-io tests: differences between your std-out and the desired std-out
See:  `your _diffs/ ` and  `your _outputs ` to determine what went wrong. 
We run these diffs automatically, so you may not need to manually inspect these files.

## Unit tests: we're micromanaging your functions!
See the unit tests themselves, and run them in your favorite debugger:
 `unit _tests/ `

## Git
Git happens...

### add, commit, push
From within your git repository (folder), add, commit, and push all the non-generated files. 
This means add your cpp and png files, but not a.out, etc.
Verify you can see the files on git-classes in the web interface.
If you can see the correct files on git-classes in your master branch, your submission is complete.
Make sure all the requested files are in the root directory of the repository unless otherwise specified.

## Errors
You should not change any of the grading files themselves. 
If you do, you will see a warning, and it will give you a 0.
If you accidentally did that:
`git checkout firstfourcharactersoflastcommitbyus graderfileyoubroke`

### Is the auto-grader broken?
Is the error you're encountering our fault or yours?
Either may be possible, while the latter is a bit more likely.
Double-check all the diffs, and step through all code to see.
If you think you found a bug, please let us know!

## When is this due?
See the syllabus!
