# Welcome to the SilverBullet Playground
This is a fully functional SilverBullet instance that **resets every 15 minutes.**

So go ahead, play around, but don't keep anything valuable here. It will be gone in a snap.

## Don‚Äôt just sit there, try it!
* Click on the page picker (book icon) icon at the top right, or hit `Cmd-k` (Mac) or `Ctrl-k` (Linux and Windows) to open the **page switcher**. Type the name of a non-existent page to create it (although it won‚Äôt save in this environment).
* Click on the terminal button (top right) or hit `Cmd-/` (Mac) or `Ctrl-/` (Linux and Windows) to open the **command palette** (note that not all commands will work in this mode).
* Select some text and hit `Alt-m` to ==highlight== it, or `Cmd-b` (Mac) or `Ctrl-b` (Windows/Linux) to make it **bold**, or `Cmd-i` (Mac) or `Ctrl-i` (Windows/Linux) to make it _italic_.
* Click a link somewhere on this page to navigate there.
* Start typing `[[` somewhere to insert a page link (with completion).
* [ ] Tap this box üëà to mark this task as done.
* Start typing `:party` to trigger the emoji picker üéâ
* Type `/` somewhere in the text to invoke a **slash command**.
* Click this button {[Editor: Toggle Vim Mode]} to toggle Vim mode
* Open this site on your phone or tablet and... it just works!
* Are you using a browser with **PWA support** (e.g., any Chromium-based
  browser or recent version of Safari)? Click on that little icon to the right of your location bar that says ‚ÄúInstall SilverBullet‚Äù to give SB its own window frame and desktop icon, like it is a stand-alone app. Now, unplug your network cable and reload the page. It still works!
