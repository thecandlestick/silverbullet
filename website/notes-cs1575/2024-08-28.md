## _const_ and Pointers

The _const_ keyword can be applied to pointers in two different ways. The _const_ can be applied to the type that the pointer points to, or it can be applied to the pointer itself. This gives, in total, four possible variations.

[[examples/ptr-const]]
```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  int x = 3;
  const int y = 7;

  int *p;                   // non-const ptr to non-const var
  const int *q;             // non-const ptr to const var
  int * const r = &x;       // const ptr to non-const var
  const int * const s = &y;  // const ptr to const var

  p = &x;
  // p = &y;  INVALID
  q = &y;
  q = &x;
  //*q = 13;  INVALID, q treats x as const when de-referenced
  *r = 4;
  //r = &y;  INVALID
  
return 0;
}
```


## Pointers as Parameters / RetVal

```c++
void foo( int *a );  // takes int pointer as arg
int* bar( char c );  // returns an int pointer
```

## Pointers & Arrays 

```c++
int *a[5]; // array of 5 integer pointers
```

[[examples/ptr-arrays]]
```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  int z[5];
  int *p, *q;

  p = &z[0];
  p = &z[2];

  q = z;      // pointers & arrays are "siblings"
  q[1] = 3;
  p[1] = 7;

  return 0;
}
```

## Pointers & Classes

When you have a pointer to a class object, the -> operator provides a convenient way to access member variables and member functions. 

```ptr -> mem``` _de-references_ **ptr**, and then accesses **mem**. This is useful because the ‚Äú.‚Äù (access) operator happens before the * (de-reference) operator in terms of precedence.

[[examples/ptr-class]]
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Tiger üêØ
{
  string name;
  int *q;
};

class Fish üêü
{
  private:
    int fins;
    int gills;
  public:
    void swim() { cout << "just keep swimming ... "; }
};

int main()
{
  Fish Nemo;
  Fish* p = &Nemo;
  
  // *(p.fins) = 3;  INVALID! p has no member fins
  (*p).fins = 3;   // Valid, access member x of *p
  p -> fins = 3;
  p -> gills = 1.61;  // Valid, access member s of *p
  p -> swim();

  return 0;
}
```

[[Dynamic Memory]]

# Dynamic Memory

Standard variables are created at _compile time_, but it is also possible to create variables on-demand during _run time_.

Variables created during run time have no name by which to refer to them. Instead, pointers are used to track and manage these _dynamic_ variables.

Standard variables exist in a part of memory known as the **stack**. Dynamic variables exist in a different part of memory known as the **heap.**

[[snippet/ops/cpp-new-delete]]
## _new_ Operator

(Dynamically) Allocates a new variable or array of variables to the heap and returns a pointer to it

```my_pointer = new <type>``` used for dynamic variables

```my_pointer = new <type>[<size>]``` for dynamic arrays

## _delete_ Operator

Unlike local variables that get removed when leaving their scope, dynamic variables can persist indefinitely. It is therefore the _programmer‚Äôs_ responsibility to clean up after themselves. the _delete_ operator must be used to de-allocate a dynamic variable.

```delete <ptr>;```  used for dynamic variables

```delete [] <ptr>;```  used for dynamic arrays


[[examples/ptr-new-delete]]
```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  int x, y;
  int *p = new int;
  cin >> x;
  int *q = new int[x];
  Fish *f = new Fish; // user-defined class, Fish

  delete p;     // p = nullptr;
  delete [] q;  // q = nullptr;
  delete f;     // f = nullptr;

  return 0;
}
```

## Problems with Pointers

**Dangling Pointers** are pointers that are used with invalid addresses. This can happen if the pointer is uninitialized, used after being de-allocated, or if the address being stored is unintentionally changed.

==Calling _delete_ **DOES NOT** alter the pointer in any way==. It **ONLY** de-allocates the memory used by the object being _pointed to_.

**Invalid Reads/Writes** occur when pointers are used to read or write to memory that doesn‚Äôt belong to your program. It is important to note that even if the pointer stores a valid memory address, it can still perform an invalid read/write!

[[examples/ptr-dangling]]
```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  int *p;
  // *p = 5;  Where is *p?

  p = new int[3];

  // p[10] = 7;      Invalid Write
  // int x = p[10];  Invalid Read
  delete [] p;
  // p[3] = 8;  Dangling Pointer!

  return 0;
}
```
