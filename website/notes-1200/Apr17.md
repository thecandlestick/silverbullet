# Graphs

#Definition A _graph_ **G** consists of two sets:
* A **Vertex Set** (**V(G)**) containing **Vertices/Nodes**
* An **Edge Set** (**E(G)**) relating elements of **V**

![](../img/graph.png)
Each **edge** in **E** is associated with two vertices from **V** called **endpoints**


#Definition _graph terminology:_
* An edge **e** with endpoints **{v,w}** is said to be **incident on v** (and _incident on w_)
* Any two _vertices_ that are joined by an _edge_ are said to be **adjacent**
* Edges that share the same endpoints are called **parallel edges**
* An edge of the form _{v, v}_ where _v_ is some vertex is called a **loop**
* A Vertex that is not part of any edges is known as a **isolated vertex**

#DiscussionQuestion Identify any _parallel edges, loops, or isolated vertices_ in the graph below
![](../img/graph-elements.png)
| Edge | Endpoints |
|----------|----------|
| e1 | {v1, v2} |
| e2 | {v1, v3} |
| e3 | {v1, v3} |
| e4 | {v2, v3} |
| e5 | {v5, v6} |
| e6 | {v5, v5} |
| e7 | {v6, v6} |

**Parallel edges:** e1, e2
**Loops:** e7, e6
**Isolated Vertices:** v4

#Definition The **degree** of a vertex **v** is the number of edges _incident_ on **v**

For the purposes of degree, a _loop_ **{v,v}** counts as two edges _incident_ on **v**

#Definition The **total degree** of a graph **G** is the sum of the degrees of all elements in **V(G)**

#DiscussionQuestion Consider any arbitrary graph with **|E(G)|** edges. Without drawing **G**, what is its _total degree_?

---
#Definition Given two graphs, **H** and **G**, we say that **H** is a **subgraph of G** if and only if **V(H)** is a subset of **V(G)** and **E(H)** is a subset of **E(G)**

#BoardQuestion Draw all possible _subgraphs_ of the graph below

## Directed & Weighted Graphs

#Definition In a **directed graph** (or **digraph**), the _edge-set_ _E(G)_ is replaced with a set of _directed edges_, **D(G)**

A _directed edge_, **d**, is associated with an element from **V(G) x V(G)**. That is, an ordered pair **(v,w)** where **v,w** are _vertices_ of **G**. In this case, **d** is the **directed edge from v to w**

![](../img/directed-graph.png)

_note:_
In some texts, all edges are directed and _undirected graphs_ are considered a special case where **D(G)** is _symmetric_

---

#Definition In a **weighted graph**, edges are further associated with a real-valued **weight**. 

Since edges are used to represent a relationship between the elements of **V(G)**, this weight can be used to express that some elements are _more related_ or _less related_ than others.

# Graph Representations

_What do vertices represent?_ **Anything**
_What do edges represent?_ **A relationship between anything and anything**
_What are graphs used for?_ ðŸ¤¯ **ANYTHING!** ðŸ¤¯

Graphs are a powerful tool used to represent any _relationship_ between elements of a set

![](../img/graph-representations.png)

_examples:_
* Communication in computer networks
* Travel-networks / road-systems
* Social networks
* Circuit design
* Outbreak of disease
* Water flow in plumbing systems
* Possible decision-making routes to goal condition

#DiscussionQuestion In the examples above, what would the _vertices_ represent? What would the _edges_ represent?

Itâ€™s important to remember for any _graph representation_ that what matters is the _logical relationship_ between vertices and **NOT** the visual depiction of the graph

In other words, a graph **G** is _uniquely identified_ by **V(G)** and **E(G)**

#BoardQuestion Label the vertices and edges in the two graphs below to demonstrate that they are in fact the same graph

# Special Types of Graphs

#Definition A graph containing any parallel edges is referred to as a **multigraph** 

#Definition A **simple graph** is graph with no _loops_ and no _parallel edges_

![](../img/simple-graph.png)
#DiscussionQuestion Do the following graphs exist? Draw an example if so

* A graph with 4 vertices of degree 1,1,2,3
* A graph with 4 vertices of degree 1,1,3,3
* A _simple graph_ with 4 vertices of degree 1,1,3,3

#Definition A **complete graph** is one in which there is an edge **(v,w)** for every possible pairing of vertices **v,w**

![](img/complete-graph.png)

#ChallengeQuestion Can you apply the techniques learned in [[Combinatorics & Probability]] to count the number of _subgraphs_ for a _complete graph_ of **n** vertices?

---
#Definition In a **bipartite graph**, the vertices **V(G)** can be partitioned into two sets **U1, U2** such that no edge connects two elements of **U1** or two elements of **U2**

![](img/exact_cover_graph.svg)


These graphs are often applied to _matching problems_ such as:
* Distributing tasks (**U1**) to employees (**U2**)
* Optimally pairing organ donors (**U1**) with compatible recipients (**U2**)
* Finding trading-sequences between sellers (**U1**) and buyers (**U2**) of various products

#Definition A **complete bipartite graph** is a _bipartite_ graph where every element of **U1** is _adjacent_ to every element of **U2**
