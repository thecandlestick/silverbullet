### The Tower of Hanoi

This is a very famous game involving moving stacks of increasingly sized rings around 3 or more pegs [Try it youself](http://towersofhanoi.info/Play.aspx)

It is a topic that has long inspired mathematicians and computer scientists alike as a very elegant example of the _magic_ of recursion.
Let’s tackle the challenge of writing an algorithm to produce a list of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi

# Recursion and Data Structures

Some data structures are purposefully designed with recursion in mind, or just so happen to store data using a recursive structure.

There is a particularly deep body of data structures that use [[Trees]] to represent data, which are inherently recursive objects and thus lend themselves well to operations implemented by recursive algorithms.

We have already seen an example of a recursive data structure; however, when we noted that the _ListNode_ class alone is sufficient to implement the _List_ abstract data type. To think of these operations recursively, simply note that the _next_ pointer for each node in this implementation points to either:
  * nullptr (**Base Case**)
  * a smaller (size n-1) list (**Recursive Case**)


As an exercise, how might you write a recursive version of the _Find_ or _Size_ operations for this particular list implementation?

# The Efficiency of Recursion

We’ve seen how recursion is a powerful tool for helping us think about problems differently and create elegant solutions, but how does it relate to the efficiency of our programs?

## When Recursion goes wrong

A classic example of recursion is that of the _Fibonacci Sequence_

  _1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ..._

Where the i-th Fibonacci number is the sum of the two previous, with the exception that the first and second numbers are _1, 1_

This is so often to introduce recursion to programmers because it’s so simple. The i-th Fibonacci number is so clearly recursively defined that the algorithm practically writes itself!

```c++
int fib(int i) // return the i-th Fibonacci number
{
  if (i == 1 || i == 2) // Base Cases
    return 1;

  return fib(i-1) + fib(i-2); // Recursive Case
}
```

However, those programmers (hopefully) then come to learn that this algorithm is horribly inefficient and are taught a much better iterative algorithm to use instead.

So what gives? Why is something so quintessentially recursive in nature such a bad candidate for a recursive algorithm?
* **Are all recursive algorithms _horribly inefficient_?** (no)
* **Should we always try to use iteration instead?** (not necessarily)
* **Is recursion _scary_?** (not if you understand where fib() goes wrong)

What you need to avoid in a recursive algorithm is _redundant sub-problems_. Taking a _top-down_ approach (starting at fib(i) and working towards the base case of fib(1) or fib(2)) causes you to re-compute a lot of information that you already know.

fib(6) makes a call to fib(5), then a call to fib(4). However, the 4th Fibonacci number was already calculated in the call to fib(5)! 

![](../img%2Ffib.png)
This wasteful re-calculation very quickly gets out of hand, and it’s why a _bottom-up_ approach like the iterative algorithm is the correct choice.

Note that there is a technique in the field of _Dynamic Programming_ for tackling this problem of redundant sub-problems known as _memoization_, but it is beyond the scope of this course.



## Recursion is looping, looping is Recursion

It may not come as a surprise that iteration and recursion are often two sides of the same coin. After all, loops in C++ can be thought of as shorthand for recursive functions.

```c++
for( init ; test ; update )
{
  body
}

void loop(i)
{
  if (test(i) == false)
    return

  body(i)
  loop(update(i))
}
```

```c++
while (test)
{
  body
}

void loop()
{
  if (test == false)
    return

  body
  loop()
}
```

This is not actually how looping works in C++, but you can see how they are logically equivalent for solving problems. That is why simple recursive algorithms are often interchangeable with their iterative counterparts.

However, for more some recursive algorithms there is not always an obvious iterative equivalent. In these instances, if we want a non-recursive algorithm that behaves the same we need to _simulate_ recursion by replacing the _call stack_ with a stack of our own.

```c++
int fake_recursive_factorial(int n)
{
  vector<int> stack;
  int result = 1;
  while(n > 1)  // simulating recursive calls
  {
    stack.push_back(n);
    n--;
  } // [  ]
  while(!stack.empty()) // simulating those functions returning
  {
    result *= stack.back();
    stack.pop_back();
  }

  return result;
}
```

This is a sometimes helpful optimization to make when the amount of information passed between recursive calls is relatively small and is often employed for tree/graph _traversals_.
