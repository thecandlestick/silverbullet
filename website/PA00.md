# Development Environment Setup

---
### Task 1: Environment Setup

Start by reading through [[Dev Environment]] and following the instructions that pertain to you to obtain a Linux development environment.

**If you are using mill-classes:**
  
  ==Take a screenshot when you successfully see the ```Apptainer>``` prompt and save it as “env.png”== (CASE SENSITIVE)

**If you are using a VM or personal device:**

  Open a _terminal_ and run the following command to test your environment:
    ```sudo -v```
  
  In a properly configured environment, you may be prompted for your password but otherwise nothing will happen. If an error message appears, contact me or attend office hours for help. ==Take a screenshot of the results and save it as “env.png”== (CASE SENSITIVE)

## Task 2: Git-classes

Navigate to https://git-classes.mst.edu and log in. You should see an assignment (this one) posted. If you do not, contact me by email or come to office hours as soon as possible.

Next, read [[Assignment Tutorial]] thoroughly and follow the instructions for starting your assignment.

==take another screenshot after successfully cloning your repository and name it “git.png”== (CASE SENSITIVE)

---
## Screenshots:

Place the screenshots for the previous tasks (env.png and git.png) inside the assignment folder (in the same folder as grade.sh). Make sure to use these exact names and do not forget to commit these files to the repository.

You may find it convenient to upload these PNG files through the git-classes web interface. If you do, you must run the command **git pull** in your Dev Environment terminal before you continue. If you skip this step, you may experience issues when going to submit your assignment.

## Task 3: C++ Warm-up

For your first assignment, you’ll be tackling a million dollar problem 💰🤑💸 ! In May 24, 2000, The Clay Mathematics Institute the Millennium Prize Problems consisting of seven of the most challenging and important unsolved problems in all of Mathematics.

One of the most famous problems is the [Collatz Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture), which is notable for being easy to understand but seemingly impossible to solve! It goes like this ...

```
Start with any positive integer (i)
  while i is greater than 1
    if i is even, divide it by 2
    else, multiply i by 3 and add 1

EX: 42 -> 21 -> 64 -> 32 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
```

Lothar Collatz conjectured that the process will _eventually_ reach 1 for _any_ positive integer starting point, but it has never been proven despite nearly a century of work and a $1,000,000 incentive!

Your assignment will have you compute the **total stopping time** of an integer, which is the number of iterations it takes to reach 1. For example, 42 has a total stopping time of 8 as illustrated above.

## Input / Output:

The input will consist of an integer _n_ followed by _n_ integers _k_, where 1 <= _k_ <= 10,000.

For each integer _k_, compute the _total stopping time_ (t) and output 
```
Total stopping time of <t>
```

### Sample I/O:

For an input of:

```
3
1
9
1024
```

Your main.cpp should produce an output of:

```
Total stopping time of 0
Total stopping time of 19
Total stopping time of 10
```

Notice that the first line of the input is not a number to compute total stopping time for, but instead an indicator of how many numbers will be inputted. **Your output should match this exactly**, that means **do not** add any _extra_ output such as prompting the user or you will lose points. 

## Scoring:

To get full points on the assignment...
* Include the necessary screenshots in your assignment folder
* Implement the functions in _Collatz.h_ **(unit_tests)**
* Complete the _main()_ function in _main.cpp_ to compute the total stopping times for a collection of integers **(stdio_tests)**
* Address any warnings given by cppcheck **(static analysis)**
* Format your code using the clang-format utility **(style check)**
