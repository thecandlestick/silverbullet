SilverBullet has infrastructure to “unfurl” — that is: replace with something nice — various types of URLs. Unfurling can be triggered by putting your cursor on any “naked” URL, and running the {[Link: Unfurl]} command.

Plugs can provide custom unfurls for specific URL patterns. For instance the [[🔌 Twitter]] plug provides the ability to unfurl tweets, and pull in their content.

[[🔌 Editor]] provides a generic URL unfurl, adding a title for a url.
