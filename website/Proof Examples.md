# Problem 1

If x+y is irrational then x is irrational or y is irrational

# Problem 2

If the sum of two positive integers is greater than 400 then at least one is greater than 200

# Problem 3

_Prove or Disprove:_

for every integer n, if n is odd then (n-1)/2 is odd.

# Problem 4

If m + n is even then m and n are both even or both odd

# Problem 5

If xy is even then x is even or y is even

# Problem 6

If n^2 - 2n + 7 is even then n is odd

# Problem 7

The product of any even int and any int is even

# Problem 8

For all real numbers a, b, if a < b then a^2 < b^2

# Problem 9

If a, b are odd ints, then a^2 + b^2 is even

# Challenge

```latex
\forall a,b,c \in \Z, (a \mid b) \land (a \nmid c) \rightarrow a \nmid (b+c)
```
