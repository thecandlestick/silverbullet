# Quantified Statements

A **Quantified Statement** is a _proposition_ that makes a logical claim about a _quantity_ of elements in the domain of a _predicate_ using terms such as “all”, “every”, “some”, or “at least one”

## Universal Statements

_note: the symbol ∀ is read as “for all”_

#Definition a **universal statement** is a proposition with the form:
```latex
\forall x \in D, Q(x)
```
where **Q(x)** is a _predicate_ and **D** is the _domain_ of **x**

A _universal statement_ is defined to be _true_ if and only if **Q(x)** is true for _every_ value of **x** in **D**

A _universal statement_ is _false_ if and only if **Q(x)** is false for _at least one_ value of **x** in **D**. This is known as a **counterexample**

_example:_ If D is the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, then
```latex
\forall x \in D, x^2 \geq x
```
is a _universal statement_

#DiscussionQuestion is the above statement _true_ or _false_? How would you prove your answer?

## Existential Statements

_note: the symbol ∃ is read as “there exist(s)”_

#Definition An **existential statement** is a _proposition_ with the form:
```latex
\exists x \in D \text{ such that } Q(x)
```
where **Q(x)** is a _predicate_ and **D** is the _domain_ of **x**

An _existential statement_ is defined to be _true_ if and only if **Q(x)** is true for _at least one_ value of **x** in **D**

An _existential statement_ is _false_ if and only if **Q(x)** is false for _every_ value of **x** in **D**

_example:_
```latex
\exists m \in \Z^+ \text{ such that } m^2 = m
```
is an _existential statement_

#DiscussionQuestion is the above statement _true_ or _false_? How would you prove your answer?

## Universal Conditional Statements

#Definition a **universal conditional statement** is a _proposition_ with the form:
```latex
\forall x \in D, P(x) \rightarrow Q(x)
```
where **P(x)** and **Q(x)** are _predicates_ and **D** is the domain of **x**

A _universal conditional statement_ is defined to be _true_ if and only if _every_ value of **x** in **D** that makes **P(x)** true also makes **Q(x)** true

A _universal conditional statement_ is false if and only if there is _at least one_ value of **x** in **D** that makes **P(x)** true and **Q(x)** false

_example:_
```latex
\forall x \in \R , x > 2 \rightarrow x^2 > 4 
```
is a _universal conditional statement_

### Necessary & Sufficient Conditions

The concepts of _necessary_ and _sufficient_ conditions can be extended for _predicates_ using _universal conditional statements_.

For _predicates_ **R(x)** and **S(x)** with domain **D**,

```latex
\forall x \in D, R(x) \text{ is a sufficient condition for } S(x)
```
means
```latex
\forall x \in D, R(x) \rightarrow S(x)
```

```latex
\forall x \in D, R(x) \text{ is a necessary condition for } S(x)
```
means
```latex
\forall x \in D, \sim R(x) \rightarrow \sim S(x)
```

## Negating Quantified Statements

#Theorem The _negation_ of a _universal statement_
```latex
\sim (\forall x \in D, Q(x))
```
is an _existential statement_ with the form:
```latex
\exists x \in D \text{ such that } \sim Q(x)
```

#Theorem The _negation_ of an _existential statement_
```latex
\sim (\exists x \in D \text{ such that } Q(x))
```
is a _universal statement_ with the form:
```latex
\forall x \in D, \sim Q(x)
```

#Theorem The _negation_ of a _universal conditional statement_
```latex
\sim (\forall x \in D, P(x) \rightarrow Q(x))
```
is an _existential statement_ with the form:
```latex
\exists x \in D \text{ such that } (P(x) \land \sim Q(x))
```

#DiscussionQuestion Suppose you have an empty bowl and various-colored balls beside it. If you make the claim “all the balls in the bowl are blue”, have you made a _true_ statement or a _false_ statement?

# Statements with Multiple Quantifiers

Beware of sentences that can have an ambiguous meaning such as:
“**There is a person supervising every detail of the production process**”

It is sometimes necessary to use statements containing multiple quantifiers in order to make your meaning clear

_examples:_
* _For every detail of the production process, there exists a person who is the supervisor of that particular detail_

* _There exists a single person who is the supervisor for all details of the production process_

For a predicate **P(x,y)** with a domain **D** for **x** and a domain **E** for **y**:
```latex
\forall x \in D, \exists y \in E \text{ such that } P(x,y)
```
is a _proposition_ that means no matter the choice of the value for **x**, you can always find a corresponding value for **y** that makes **P(x,y)** _true_

```latex
\exists x \in D \text{ such that } \forall y \in E, P(x,y)
```
is a _proposition_ that means there is at least one choice of the value for **x** such that no matter the choice of the value for **y**, **P(x,y)** is always _true_

_examples:_
```latex
\exists m \in \Z^+ \text{ such that } \forall n \in \Z^+, m \leq n
```
```latex
\exists m \in \R^+ \text{ such that } \forall n \in \R^+, m \leq n
```
```latex
\forall m \in \R^+ , \exists n \in \R^+ \text{ such that } m \leq n
```
```latex
\forall m \in \mathbb{Q}^+, \exists n \in \mathbb{Q}^+ \text{ such that } m > n\\

```

#DiscussionQuestion Are the statements given above _true_? What would be sufficient evidence to declare them as _false_?
