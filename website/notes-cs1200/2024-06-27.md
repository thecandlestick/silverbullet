# Set Theory

## Multi-set Union & Multi-set Intersection notation

#Definition If **A** is an _indexed collection of sets_, then the symbol
```latex
\bigcup_{i=0}^nA_i
```
represents the set containing all elements belonging to _at least one_ set in **A_0, A_1, ... , A_n**


#Definition If **A** is an _indexed collection of sets_, then the symbol
```latex
\bigcap_{i=0}^nA_i
```
represents the set containing all elements that belong to _every_ set in **A_0, A_1, ... , A_n**

_example:_

Let **A** be a collection of sets defined below:
```latex
A_i = \{x \in \R \mid -\frac{1}{i} < x < \frac{1}{i}\}
```

Then,
```latex
\bigcup_{i=1}^3A_i = A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3\\
= \{-1 < x < 1\} \cup \{-\frac{1}{2} < x < \frac{1}{2}\} \cup \{-\frac{1}{3} < x < \frac{1}{3}\}\\
= \{ x \in \R \mid -1 < x < 1 \}
```
and
```latex
\bigcap_{i=1}^3A_i = A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_3\\
= \{-1 < x < 1\} \cap \{-\frac{1}{2} < x < \frac{1}{2}\} \cap \{-\frac{1}{3} < x < \frac{1}{3}\}\\
= A_3
```

#DiscussionQuestion Suppose that there are an infinite number of indexed sets in **A**, defined as above. What would be the value of
```latex
\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i\\
\text{and}\\
\bigcap_{i=1}^\infty A_i
```

{x in R | -1 < x < 1} <- Union
{0} <- Intersection

## Partitions

#Definition If **A** and **B** are sets, then we say that **A** and **B** are **disjoint** or **mutually exclusive** if and only if they share no common elements.
```latex
\text{A and B are mutually exclusive} \Leftrightarrow A \cap B = \emptyset
```

#Definition If **A, B**, and **C** are sets, then we say that **A** and **B** **exhaust** or **cover** **C** if and only if **C** is equal to the _union_ of **A** and **B**.
```latex
\text{A and B exhaust C} \Leftrightarrow A \cup B = C
```

#Definition If **A** is a set and **P** is an _indexed collection of sets_, then **P** is a **partition** of **A** if and only if:
* The elements of **P** are _non-empty_ sets
* The elements of **P** are _mutually exclusive_
* The elements of **P** _exhaust_ **A**
```latex
\text{P is a partition of A} \Leftrightarrow \\

\emptyset \notin P\\
\bigcap_{i=0}^nP_i = \emptyset\\
\bigcup_{i=0}^nP_i = A
```
where **n** is the number of sets in **P**

_example:_

Let **T** be an indexed collection of sets defined below:
```latex
T_0 = \{n \in \Z \mid \exists k \in \Z, n=3k\}\\
T_1 = \{n \in \Z \mid \exists k \in \Z, n=3k+1\}\\
T_2 = \{n \in \Z \mid \exists k \in \Z, n=3k+2\}\\
```

n = 3q + r, 0 <= r < 3

Is **T** a _partition_ of the set of all integers?
_hint: Quotient-remainder theorem_

#KnowledgeCheck True or False: 
**{{a,d,e},{b,c},{d,f}}** is a _partition_ of **{a,b,c,d,e,f}**
False, not mutually exclusive

## Ordered Pairs & Cartesian Products

(x,y) (0,1) 
(y,x) (1,0)

#Definition For elements **a** and **b**, the set **{{a},{a,b}}**, also denoted **(a,b)**, is the **ordered pair** where **a** is the _first element_ and **b** is the _second element_

Two _ordered pairs_, **(a,b)** and **(c,d)**, are _equal_ if and only if **a = c** and **b = d**

This concept of an ordered pair becomes very important as sets in general have no way of expressing an order to the elements within.

#Definition Given sets **A** and **B**, the **Cartesian product** of **A** and **B**, denoted **A x B**, is the set of all _ordered pairs_ **(a,b)** where **a** is in **A** and **b** is in **B**.
```latex
A \times B = \{(a,b) \mid (a \in A) \land (b \in B)\}
```

This definition can be generalized for the **Cartesian product** of _n_ sets, which will produce a set of _ordered n-tuples_.
```latex
A \times B \times C = \{(a,b,c) \mid (a \in A) \land (b \in B) \land (c \in C)\}
```

#BoardQuestion Let **A = {x,y}**, **B = {1,2,3}**, and **C = {a,b}**
Calculate the following _Cartesian products_:
* **A x C** - {(x,a),(x,b),(y,a),(y,b)}
  
* **A x B x C** - {(x,1,a),(x,1,b),(x,2,a),(x,2,b),(x,3,a),(x,3,b),(y,1,a),(y,1,b),(y,2,a),(y,2,b),(y,3,a),(y,3,b)}


* **(A x B) x C** - {((x,1),a), ((x,2),a), ((x,3),a), ((y,1),a), ((y,2),a), ((y,3),a), ((x,1),b), ((x,2),b), ((x,3),b), ((y,1),b), ((y,2),b), ((y,3),b)}

  * (A x B) - {(x, 1), (x,2), (x,3), (y,1), (y,2), (y,3)}
