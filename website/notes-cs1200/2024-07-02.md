# Relations

#Definition Let **A** and **B** be sets. A **relation R from A to B** is a subset of **A x B** _(Cartesian product)_. For given elements **x** in **A** and **y** in **B**, we say that **x is related to y by R**, or **x R y**, if and only if the ordered pair **(x,y)** is in the set **R**

The **inverse** of a _relation_ **R** is defined as:
```latex
R^{-1} = \{(y,x) \in B \times A \mid (x,y) \in R \}
```

_examples:_

Let **A = {1,2}** and **B = {1,2,3}**. Define a _relation_ **R** as follows:
```latex
R = \{(x,y) \in A \times B \mid \frac{x-y}{2} \in \Z \}
```

#DiscussionQuestion Which ordered pairs are included in the relation **R**?
Can **R** be considered a function?

R = {(1,1), (1,3), (2,2)}

**The _Divides_ Relation**

Let **R** be a _relation_ from **X** to **Y** where:
```latex
x R y \Leftrightarrow x | y\\
X = \{2,3,4\}\\
Y = \{2,6,8\}\\
X \times Y = \{(2,2),(2,6),(2,8),\\
\qquad \qquad \quad (3,2),(3,6),(3,8),\\
\qquad \qquad \quad (4,2),(4,6),(4,8)\}
```

Then **R** = { (2,2),(2,6),(2,8),(3,6),(4,8) }

... And the inverse **R‚Äô** = **(y,x)** where _y is divisible by x_ = { (2,2),(6,2),(8,2),(6,3), (8,4) }

**The _absolute value_ Relation**

Let **R** be a _relation_ from the set of reals to the set of reals where:
```latex
x R y \Leftrightarrow y = 2|x|
```

Draw graphs of **R** and **R‚Äô**. Is either _relation_ also a _function_?

**Types of Relations:**

* **A x A** - Relation on **A**
- **A x B** - Binary Relation (from **A** to **B**)
- **A x B x C** - Ternary Relation 
- **A x B x C x D** - Quaternary Relation
- **A1 x A2 x ... x An** - _N-ary_ Relation

**Use case: Relational Databases**

Define the following sets:
* **A** - A set of 8-digit positive integers (_student id_)
* **B** - A set of character strings (_student name_)
* **C** - A set of dates ‚ÄúFS/SP/SS YY‚Äù (_student graduation date_)
* **D** - A set of character strings (_student major_)

Now let **R** be a quaternary relation on **A x B x C x D** such that:

  Element **(a,b,c,d)** in **R** means - ‚ÄúA student with ID **a**, named **b**, is set to graduate on **c**, with primary major **d**‚Äú

Then a collection of S&T students could be represented by this relation

* (00000001, Joe Miner, FS 70, Mining Engineering)
* (12876543, Joe Schmo, SP 24, Applied Mathematics)
* (12812096, Joe Dirt, SP 26, Mechanical Engineering)
* (12833378, Joe Mama, FS 21, Computer Science)
* (18097865, Joe King, SP 24, Computer Engineering)
* (18001239, Joe Joestar, SP 25, Biology)

In a database, these tuples are thought of as rows in a table with columns for each attribute

| ID | Name | Grad-Year | Major |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| 00000001 | Joe Miner | FS 70 | Mining Engineering |
| 12876543 | Joe Schmo | SP 24 | Applied Mathematics |
| 12812096 | Joe Dirt | SP 26 | Mechanical Engineering |
| 12833378 | Joe Mama | FS 21 | Computer Science |
| 18097865 | Joe King | SP 24 | Computer Engineering |
| 18001239 | Joe Joestar | SP 25 | Biology |

A _query language_ such as SQL would then be used to perform operations on this relation, manipulating or retrieving specific elements

  _SELECT Name FROM R WHERE Grad-Year = SP 24_

Would, for example, return a list of Names for every student who is graduating in Spring of 2024. This information can be obtained by performing various set operations

Consider the set: **A x B x {‚ÄúSP 24‚Äù} x D**, call this **Q**

This would correspond to the table:

| ID | Name | Grad-Year | Major |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| ... | ... | SP 24 | ... |
| 00000001 | Joe Miner | SP 24 | Mining Engineering |
| 12876543 | Joe Schmo | SP 24 | Applied Mathematics |
| 12812096 | Joe Dirt | SP 24 | Mechanical Engineering |
| 12833378 | Joe Mama | SP 24 | Computer Science |
| 18097865 | Joe King | SP 24 | Computer Engineering |
| 18001239 | Joe Joestar | SP 24 | Biology |
| ... | ... | SP 24 | ... |

Now take the _intersection_ of **R** and **Q**. This result will contain only elements from the original set **R** where _Grad-Year = SP 24_

| ID | Name | Grad-Year | Major |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| 12876543 | Joe Schmo | SP 24 | Applied Mathematics |
| 18097865 | Joe King | SP 24 | Computer Engineering |


Now perform a **projection** onto the second coordinate to narrow this table down to the information requested

| Name |

# Properties of Relations on Sets

A relation on a set **A** can be represented using a _directed graph_

_example:_

Let **A = {3,4,5,6,7,8}**
Define relation **R** on **A** such that:
```latex
x R y \Leftrightarrow 2|(x-y)
```

#BoardQuestion Draw a graph with arrows indicating related elements

_Extra example:_
Let **B = {2,3,4,6,7,9}**
Define relation **R** on **B** such that:
```latex
xRy \Leftrightarrow 3 \mid (x-y)
```


## Reflexivity

#Definition A relation **R** on a set **A** is **reflexive** if and only if for all **x** in **A**, **x R x**
```latex
R\text{ is reflexive} \Leftrightarrow \forall x \in A, (x,x) \in R
```

Another way of wording this property is that in a _reflexive relation_, each element is related to itself.

To demonstrate that a relation is not _reflexive_, you must find an element of **A** that is not related to itself.
```latex
R\text{ is not reflexive} \Leftrightarrow \exists x \in A \text{ such that } (x,x) \notin R
```

#DiscussionQuestion Is the following relation on the set of integers _reflexive_?
```latex
xRy \Leftrightarrow x \times y \text{ is positive}
```

**no, counter-example = 0**
