# Equivalence Relations

#Definition Let **R** be a relation on a set **A**. **R** is an **equivalence relation** if and only if **R** is _reflexive, symmetric,_ and _transitive_

_example:_
Let **A** be a set with partition **{A_0, A_1, ..., A_n}** and let **R** be a relation on **A** such that:
```latex
xRy \Leftrightarrow \exists A_i \text{ such that }x,y \in A_i
```

This relation has a special name. It is the **relation induced by the partition** given.

If we let **A = {0,1,2,3,4}** and consider the partition **{{0,3,4},{1},{2}}**, then the _relation induced by the partition_ is 

**R = {(0,0), (0,3), (0,4), (1,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,3), (3,4), (4,0), (4,3), (4,4)}**

#DiscussionQuestion Is **R** an _equivalence relation_? Is this the same for all _relations induced by partitions_?

## Equivalence Classes

#Definition Suppose **R** is a relation on a set **A**. For each element **a** in **A**, the **equivalence class** of **a**, denoted [a], is the set of all elements **x** in **A** such that **x** is related to **a** by **R**  
```latex
[a] = \{x\in A\mid xRa\}
```

In general, a relation **R** has as many _equivalence classes_ as there are elements in **A**. Oftentimes, however, we are concerned only with the **distinct equivalence classes** of **R**. That is, all possible sets representing an _equivalence class_ but not tied to a particular element in **A**

_example:_
Let **A = {{1},{2},{3},{1,2},{1,3},{2,3},{1,2,3}}**
Define a relation **R** on **A** such that:
```latex
aRb \Leftrightarrow \text{least element in }a = \text{ least element in }b
```

Then **R = {({1},{1}), ({1},{1,2}), ({1,2},{1}), ({1},{1,3}), 
({1,3},{1}), ({1},{1,2,3}), ({1,2,3},{1}), ({1,2},{1,3}), 
({1,3},{1,2}), ({1,2},{1,2,3}), ({1,2,3},{1,2}), ({1,3},{1,2,3}), ({1,2,3},{1,3}), ({2},{2,3}), ({2,3},{2})}**

List the following _equivalence classes_:
* [{1}] = {{1}, {1,2}, {1,3}, {1,2,3}} 
* [{2}] = {{2}, {2,3}}
* [{3}] = {{3}}

### Properties of Equivalence Classes

#Theorem The following statements are true of all _equivalence relations_ **R** on a set **A**

**R is:**
* reflexive
* symmetric
* transitive

```latex
\text{If }aRb, \text{ then }[a] = [b]
```

xRa and aRb, then by transitivity xRb
by symmetry, bRa
yRb and bRa, then by transitivity yRa
```latex
\text{If }a,b \in A,\text{ then either } [a] \cap [b] = \emptyset \text{ or }[a] = [b]
```

if ~(aRb) then [a] \intersect [b] = {} (no shared elements)

if [a] and [b] have a shared element, then aRb

suppose xRa and xRb but ~(aRb)

by symmetry, aRx

aRx and xRb, then by transitivity, aRb (a contradiction)
```latex
\{[a] \mid a \in A\} \text{ is a partition of A}
```

* no empty sets (reflexive) aRa 
* mutually exclusive (by Thm 2)
* exhaustive (reflexive)


#DiscussionQuestion Think carefully about the definition of _reflexive, symmetric, and transitive_. Do they provide some intuition on why the theorems above are true?

## Congruence & Modulo

Consider a relation **R** defined on the set of integers such that:
```latex
mRn \Leftrightarrow k|(m-n)
```
where **k** is some positive integer

This relation is known as **congruence modulo k** due to the fact that it possesses the property that any two integers **m,n** are related if and only if **m _mod_ k = n _mod_ k = 0**.

* Is _congruence modulo k_ a _reflexive_ relation?

```latex
mRm \Leftrightarrow k|(m-m)\\
\Leftrightarrow k|0\\
\Leftrightarrow \exists i \in \Z \text{ such that } i\times k = 0
```

Regardless of the choice of **m** or **k**, it is clear to see that the choice of **i = 0** demonstrates that **R** is _reflexive_

* Is _congruence modulo k_ a _symmetric_ relation?

```latex
\text{Suppose }mRn \Leftrightarrow \exists i \in \Z \text{ such that }i \times k = (m - n)\\
\Leftrightarrow i = \frac{m-n}{k} \text{ is an integer}\\
\text{Now consider the symmetric relationship }nRm \Leftrightarrow \exists j \in \Z \text{ such that }j \times k = (n - m)\\
\text{Let }j = -i, \text{ then }j \times k = -i \times k\\
 = -(\frac{m-n}{k})k = \frac{n-m}{k}k = (n-m)  
```

Therefore, regardless of the choice of **m,n,k**. We can select **i,j** to demonstrate that **R** is _symmetric_

* Is _congruence modulo k_ a _transitive_ relation?

Using the property:
```latex
mRn \Leftrightarrow m \% k = n \% k = 0
```

We can see that,
```latex
mRn \land nRw \Leftrightarrow (m \% k = n \% k = 0) \land (n \% k = w \% k = 0)\\
 \Leftrightarrow m \% k = n \% k = w \% k = 0 
```

And by specification,
```latex
m \% k = w \% k = 0 \Leftrightarrow mRw
```

Therefore, regardless of the choice of **m,n,w**, the properties of _congruence modulo k_ dictate that it must be _transitive_

#DiscussionQuestion What are the _distinct equivalence classes_ of _congruence modulo 3_?

```latex
mRn \Leftrightarrow 3|(m-n)\\

[a] = \{x \in \Z \mid xRa\} = \{x \in \Z \mid 3|(x-a)\} = \{x \in \Z \mid \exists k \in \Z \text{ such that } 3k = x-a\} = \{x \in \Z \mid \exists k \in \Z \text{ such that } x = 3k+a\}\\
[0] = \{x \in \Z \mid \exists k \in \Z \text{ such that } x = 3k+0\}\\
[1] = \{x \in \Z \mid \exists k \in \Z \text{ such that } x = 3k+1\}\\
[2] = \{x \in \Z \mid \exists k \in \Z \text{ such that } x = 3k+2\}\\
[3] = \{x \in \Z \mid \exists k \in \Z \text{ such that } x = 3k+3\}\\
...
```
