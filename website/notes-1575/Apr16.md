# Operations (member functions)


## getMax / getMin

[[examples/treemap-get-max-min]]

## Find

We start with _find_. We donâ€™t directly know where everything is in a BST, so we may need this operation for other tasks as well

[[examples/treemap-find]]

## Get/Set

[[examples/treemap-get]]

## Insert

DQ: For args passed to functions, what is the difference between: 
  * MapNode *
  * MapNode *&

[[examples/treemap-insert]]

## Erase

Erasing an element from a BST while maintaining the search property can be a challenging task. We will need to come up with three separate plans for removing nodes of degree 0, 1, and 2.

Erasing a leaf node:

 _just delete it_
  
Erasing a node with 1 child:

  _promote the child of the node to be removed_

Erasing a node with 2 children:

  _promote the right-most element of left-subtree OR left-most element of right-subtree_

# Default Member Functions

## Destructor

_DQ: Is pre-order or post-order traversal better for clearing all data?_

[[examples/treemap-destructor]]

## Copy Constructor
