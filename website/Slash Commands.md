Slash commands are built-in to SilverBullet. You can trigger them by typing a `/` in your text (after whitespace).

The [[ðŸ”Œ Editor]] plug provides a few helpful ones:

* `/h1` through `/h4` to turn the current line into a header
* `/hr` to insert a horizontal rule (`---`)
* `/table` to insert a markdown table (whoever can remember this syntax without it)
* `/snippet` see [[ðŸ”Œ Template@snippets]]
* `/today` to insert todayâ€™s date
* `/tomorrow` to insert tomorrowâ€™s date

You can create custom slash commands using [[Slash Templates]].
