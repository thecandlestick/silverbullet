A _space_ is SilverBullet terminology for a workspace, or project. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) calls this a vault, [LogSeq](https://logseq.com/) calls it a graph. You may think of it as a folder or a directory â€” because in practical terms, thatâ€™s all it is.

Feel free to back-up or manipulate your space;s folder and its files with whatever tool you like â€” you donâ€™t have to use SilverBullet exclusively. You may want to turn your spaceâ€™s folder into a git repository, for instance, and do version control and back-ups that way â€” in which case you may appreciated the [[ðŸ”Œ Git]] plug.

# Pages
All pages in your space are stored as files with a `.md` file extension. While _folders_ are not really a first-class concept in SilverBullet, you can create pages with a `/` in their name, which will (under the hood) automatically create a folder structure to match it. So creating a page named `people/John` will ensure a `people` folder in your spaceâ€™s root, and put a `John.md` file in it.

# Attachments
Attachments are kept alongside the rest of your files with whatever file extension they have (e.g. `.jpg` for images, or `.pdf` for PDFs).

# Folder lay-out
Every space in SilverBullet at the very least has an index page (by default named `index.md`) and a SETTINGS page (named `SETTINGS.md`). If you install custom [[ðŸ”Œ Plugs]], these will be kept under `_plug` in your spaceâ€™s folder.
