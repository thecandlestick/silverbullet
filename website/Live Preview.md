SilverBullet uses a “live preview” markdown editor. This mechanism is heavily inspired by [Obsidian’s live preview mode](https://help.obsidian.md/Live+preview+update).

It reduces visual noise by not constantly showing [[Markdown]] codes such as `[SilverBullet website](https://silverbullet.md)`, only showing the underlying Markdown when the cursor is placed inside.

In addition, live preview is also heavily leveraged to implement [[Live Queries]] and [[Live Templates]].
