# Recursive Backtracking

--- 

## Assignment Description:

![](img/josephjones.jpg)
Joseph Jones (Grandson of the famous archeologist Jonathan Jones) is ready to follow in his father’s footsteps! He’s finally located the mystical red gem, but there’s a problem! While Joseph Jones is a cunning adventurer, his tendency to get lost has gotten the better of him this time.

Can you help our brave explorer navigate through the temple floors and reach the exit?

### Sample input/output:

**INPUT:**
```
||||||||
|      |
| |||| |
|S   |E|
||||||||
```
**OUTPUT:**
```
||||||||
|@@@@@@|
|@||||@|
|S   |E|
||||||||
```

For each maze you are to:
* Dynamically allocate an array of strings
* Fill your maze with layout from standard input
* Find the exit (if possible) via recursive backtracking, leaving a trail of ‘@‘ characters along your path
* De-allocate your maze to be used for the next floor

## Scoring:

To get full points on the assignment...
* Implement each function in the _maze_ class **(unit_tests)**
* Complete the _main()_ function to solve all mazes **(stdio_tests)**
* Fix any memory leaks or invalid memory operations **(mem_tests)**
* Address any warnings given by cppcheck **(static analysis)**
* Format your code using the clang-format utility **(style check)**

**TIPS FOR DEBUGGING THIS ASSIGNMENT**

You can inspect what's happening at a particular point in the maze by setting a conditional breakpoint

_example:_

```sh
(gdb) break find_exit
Breakpoint 2 at 0x4444: file src/maze.cpp, line 44
(gdb) condition 2 row == 2 && col == 2
(gdb) continue
```

In this example, I want to know what my code does when it reaches the coordinates (2,2), so I set a conditional breakpoint.
The first argument after _condition_ is the number of the breakpoint you want to set the condition for.

You can also print out the maze from inside gdb to check your progress with the following command:

```sh
(gdb) call print_matrix(matrix,<number-of-rows>)
```

Unfortunately, for this assignment you will have to check the number of rows for a given test matrix yourself and type that in manually.
