[[p/Teaching Statement]]


* Developed syllabus, course objectives, learning material, assessments (quizzes), programming assignments from scratch
* Contributed to open source “instant-feedback” autograder framework
* Delivered lectures to variety of course sizes:
  * small (~20)
  * medium (~75)
  * large (~175)
* Taught in both in-person and fully remote settings
* Taught in both standard (15-week) and summer session (8-week)
* Taught both laboratory courses and lecture courses
* Consistently above department and university averages in teaching effectiveness (according to student responses)
* Utilize interactive course website developed by me
  * Rapid construction and iteration on course material
  * “real-time” lecture notes engage students and aid in clarification
  * All material easily preserved as permanent student resource
  * Wiki-style layout helps students find relevant material quickly

In my view, the primary challenge of effective teaching stems from identifying the root of a student’s misunderstanding. As an expert on the subject being taught, it can be difficult for a teacher to recall challenging concepts as well as a natural order of concepts for learning.
