# Graph Data Structures

## C++ standard library implementations:

The C++ standard library does not currently provide a standard graph implementation, but a graph can be built from other existing standard lib containers.

Part of the challenge of creating an efficient _general-purpose_ graph implementation is that the efficiency of operations canâ€™t necessarily be inferred from the size of the data. The context of how the data is related is of critical importance when selecting a data structure for your graph.
