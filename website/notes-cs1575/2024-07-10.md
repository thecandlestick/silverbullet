There are many ways of defining the properties of Trees, but for this class we are most interested in their _recursive_ structure.

  * a single node is a tree
  * two trees joined by a single edge is also a tree

What does this tell us? _Any_ node in a tree forms a **sub-tree** with its descendants... recursion ensues!

# Trees and Data Structures

Instead of a _linear ordering_ of the data like that of the _sequence-based_ abstract data types weâ€™ve seen before (stack, queue, list), tree-based ADT make use of a _hierarchical_ relationship. 

It is common to define a general-purpose _Tree_ Abstract Data Type for interacting with data that has an inherent hierarchical structure (see: Applications for Trees). For this course, however, we will focus on _Tree-inspired_ ADT and Data Structures that can be applied to any collection of data but utilize a hierarchy for efficiency purposes

## Working with unordered data

Because there is no linear ordering to a tree, we need to devise algorithms for _enumerating_ the data whenever we want to traverse through it. There are a number of ways to do this and each one gives us a different _order_.

# Binary Search Trees

A BST is a **binary tree** that possesses the **search property**

* A binary tree is one in which every node has _at most_ 2 children
  * We will refer to these children as the **left-subtree** and **right-subtree**
* The _search property_ means that:
  * Every node is **comparable** with every other node and **no duplicates** are allowed
  * For any given node _N_,
    * _N_ is _lesser than_ every node in the _right-subtree_
    * _N_ is _greater than_ every node in the _left-subtree_


a < b
a > b
a == b

The primary benefit of designing data structures that maintain these properties is that it allows for efficient searching of the data by use of the [[examples/runtime-logarithm|Binary Search]] algorithm.
