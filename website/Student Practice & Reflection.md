#quote Students forget as much as 90 percent of what they learn in school within a month (Medina, 2008)

# Initial Thoughts/Impressions

* Important context: the chapter begins by noting that even when all prior stages of learning are met (ie. students are engaged, focused on new learning, and have the skills to consolidate their knowledge) they _still_ struggle to retain what they’ve learned
  
* In comparison to some other chapters, the cognitive science surrounding practice/reflection/retention seems more “settled”


* How can we measure and assess _long-term_ retention between courses? Are K-12 institutions more of a “united front” than university departments?

  * Major field test. Is the data _actually_ used?
  * Capstone courses
  * Subsequent courses

* <your impressions here>


**Repetition is Key**

repetition is necessary for retention. The scientific explanation: 

_Returning to a new memory reactivates the pathways connecting those neurons. As pathways are reactivated, the brain begins to wrap a sheath of insulation (called myelin) around them. Much like
insulation around an electrical wire that helps electrical charges move more quickly, the myelin coating makes it easier for those neurons to fire together again_

#quote Students must rehearse a new skill at least 24 times before they reach 80 percent competency (Anderson, 1995)


Ways of optimizing repetition include:
* Spacing practice sessions over several days or weeks
* Interleaving concepts or problem types


how to define ==desirable difficulties==?

_Examples:_
* Students learning to toss beanbags from 2/4 feet have to learn to judge distance and develop fine motor control. Students tossing from 3 feet only learn to rely on muscle memory
  
* Students engaging in interleaved practice learn to identify problem types whereas students engaging in blocked practice suffer more from “discrimination errors”. Better engagement

* Material on exams / crib sheet

## 9. Retrieval Practice (“Quizzing to Remember”)

#DiscussionQuestion Is there a tendency to use quizzes to measure rather than support learning?

This strategy shows very positive empirical results for “retain and recall” tasks. Most effective for building foundational knowledge rather than complex critical thinking tasks

**Demonstrably better than most other forms of studying**
  * reviewing test Q&A
  * rereading texts
  * constructing concept maps

**Works best with timely feedback**

A brief delay between question and correct answer fosters curiosity in students. Having to wait a day or more for feedback kills that opportunity

#DiscussionQuestion How to create opportunities for retrieval without eating a ton of class time? Can students be expected to abstain from using notes/etc in quizzes outside of the classroom?

* group work
* canvas question banks
* pre-made canvas resources

### Classroom Tips

* Quiz more grade less
  * #DiscussionQuestion Students often practice independently and consistently for music or sports, but most require external motivation to study. Why is this?
  * Could _indirect_ grading (such as attendance credit) be sufficient motivation for frequent, ungraded quizzing?
* Give _immediate_ feedback if possible
* Utilize _speeded_ practice for basic skills, reflective practice for complex skills

## 10. Spaced, Mixed, Independent Practice

Must break out of the “teach once, practice once, test once” cadence of learning

**Fast learning leads to fast forgetting**

#DiscussionQuestion “Cramming” is well understood to be ineffective for retention, yet is it viewed by students as an inevitability of college life. Is there anything we can do as instructors to change this perception?

**Interleaving practice problems supports greater retention**

Key benefit of “interleaved practice” over “blocked practice” is that it requires students to identify the problem type first

Can be frustrating for students as it appears to “slow down” learning

**Mixing up the presentation of problems supports greater retention**

Simply switching up the format of problems (i.e. 17 = 9+8 vs 9+8 = 17) appears to have significant benefits for students

#DiscussionQuestion Designing a diverse problem set with many different “presentations” is time consuming & mentally taxing. Is this an area where leveraging generative AI would be effective? Has anyone experimented with something along those lines?


**Follow a 3x3 practice schedule**

Rawson & Dunlosky, 2011

335 college students tasked with recalling study items 3 times

* 1st session: 6.3 minutes of practice per item
* 2nd & 3rd session: 2.7 minutes of practice per item
* 4th & 5th session: diminishing returns

Too much repetition can indeed become an inefficient use of time.
Suggests optimal schedule is 3 sessions that end when a concept is recalled 3 times

#DiscussionQuestion K-12 students receive more “in-class” time and a longer academic session per subject. Does the need to “budget” instructional time present an obstacle to this applying this strategy?

## 11. Targeted Support (Scaffolded Practice) 

Providing at-risk students with intensive strategy instruction, guided practice, and formative feedback.

#DiscussionQuestion At the college level, at-risk students can often repeat courses if necessary with minimal disruption to their degree path. Is targeted support still worthwhile?


**Targeted support can close achievement gaps**

#DiscussionQuestion Introduction of CS1500 helped close an “achievement gap” between CS freshmen with prior programming knowledge vs. beginners. Should we be taking a more “macro” approach to targeted support?

**Formative assessment data is key**

This strategy works best when targeted to student learning needs. It is also desirable to identify when additional support is no longer needed.

**Supports are most effective when delivered by trained professionals**

Does this suggest peer-tutoring is less effective for at-risk students? (no?)

The point is support should be as structured if not more than the normal lessons

**Targeted support should supplement, not supplant, good instruction**

Targeted support cannot overcome poor classroom instruction
