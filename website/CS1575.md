# Welcome to Data Structures!

 Here are some FAQ to get you started:
* **Where am I?**
  * This is the course website. Itâ€™s powered by the awesome, free, and open-source [SilverBullet](https://SilverBullet.md). Check it out if youâ€™re in the market for a personal note-taking/knowledge-base solution. Noticing ==some== **funky** _formatting_? Thatâ€™s Markdown, the syntax that gives this page its ðŸŒŸ _style_ ðŸŒŸ.
* **Where can I find lecture notes?**
  * Here! Any course material will be hosted on this site for your convenience.
* **How can I keep on top of assignments?**
  * Check out the tentative [[Course Calendar]] which will be updated throughout the semester. Assignments will be posted to https://git-classes.mst.edu/
* **Where will grades be posted?**
  * Right He- er, actually that oneâ€™s on [Canvas](https://umsystem.instructure.com/courses/197016) ðŸ˜…
