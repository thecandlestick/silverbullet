# Sequences

#Definition A **sequence** is a function whose domain is either all the integers between two given integers or all the integers greater than or equal to a given integer

The value of the function for a given input **n** is called the **n-th term** of the sequence

_examples:_
* 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...
* 1, 2, 3, ...

## Determining a Formula

Though not all sequences must follow an explicit formula, it is common to express sequences by giving an equation for calculating an arbitrary term by its index

_examples:_
```latex
A_k = 2^k\\
A_k = k\\
A_k = A_{k-1} + A_{k-2}, A_1 = 1, A_2 = 2
```

## Finding terms given explicit formulas

If an explicit formula is available, obtaining any term of the sequence becomes trivial

```latex
a_k = \frac{k}{k+1}, k \geq 1\\
b_i = \frac{i-1}{i}, i \geq 2\\
c_j = (-1)^j, j \geq 0
```

#DiscussionQuestion What are the values of the following terms?
* a_5 = **5/6**
* b_1 = **undefined**
* c_12345678987654321

1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, ...

## Determining a Formula from Terms

_example:_
```latex
1, -\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{9}, -\frac{1}{16}, \frac{1}{25}, -\frac{1}{36}, ...
```

_explicit formula:_
```latex
a_k = \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k^2}, k \geq 1
```

1/1, -1/4, 1/9, ...

#Definition An **arithmetic sequence** is a sequence of the form:
```latex
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)*d
```
where **d** is a _common difference_ separating each term

#Definition a **geometric sequence** is a sequence of the form:
```latex
a_n = a_1*r^{n-1}
```
where **r** is a _common ratio_ between each term

Many sequences can be categorized as either an _arithmetic sequence_ (if it is obtained by repeated addition)
or as a _geometric sequence_
(if is is obtained by repeated multiplication)

#KnowledgeCheck Is the following sequence _arithmetic_ or _geometric_?
```latex
1, \frac{7}{2}, 6, \frac{17}{2}, 11, ...
```
If _arithmetic_, give the common difference **d**
If _geometric,_ give the common ratio **r**

a_k = 1 + (k - 1)(5/2)

# Summations and Products of Sequences

In addition to calculating individual terms of a sequence, it is often helpful to denote the sum or product of consecutive terms.

## Summation Notation vs Expanded Form

#Definition if m and n are integers and m <= n, then the symbol
```latex
\sum_{k=m}^na_k
```
read as the **summation form from k equals m to n of a-sub-k**, is the sum of all terms in the sequence.
```latex
a_m + a_{m+1} + a_{m+2} + ... + a_n
```
is known as the **expanded form** of the sum and is equivalent to the summation form
```latex
\sum_{k=m}^na_k = a_m + a_{m+1} + a_{m+2} + ... + a_n
```

In the example above, **k** is the **index** of the summation, 
**m** is the **lower limit** of the summation, 
and **n** is the **upper limit** of the summation

_examples:_ 

Expand the following summation (convert to expanded form)
```latex
\sum_{i=0}^n\frac{(-1)^i}{i+1}
```

_ans:_
```latex
\frac{(-1)^0}{0+1} + \frac{(-1)^1}{1+1} + \frac{(-1)^2}{2+1} + ... + \frac{(-1)^n}{n+1}
```

Express in summation notation
```latex
\frac{1}{n} + \frac{2}{n+1} + \frac{3}{n+2} + ... + \frac{n+1}{2n}
```

_ans:_
```latex
\sum_{i=0}^n = \frac{i+1}{n+i}
```
