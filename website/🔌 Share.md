#plug

The Share plug provides infrastructure for sharing pages outside of your space. It standardizes the {[Share: Publish]} (bound to `Cmd-s` or `Ctrl-s`) to publish the current page to all share providers specified under the `$share` key in [[Frontmatter]].

See the [original RFC](https://github.com/silverbulletmd/silverbullet/discussions/117) for implementation details.

Specific implementations for sharing are implemented in other plugs, specifically:
```query
share-support render [[template/page]] 
```
