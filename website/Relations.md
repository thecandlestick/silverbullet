# Relations

#Definition Let **A** and **B** be sets. A **relation R from A to B** is a subset of **A x B** _(Cartesian product)_. For given elements **x** in **A** and **y** in **B**, we say that **x is related to y by R**, or **x R y**, if and only if the ordered pair **(x,y)** is in the set **R**

The **inverse** of a _relation_ **R** is defined as:
```latex
R^{-1} = \{(y,x) \in B \times A \mid (x,y) \in R \}
```

_examples:_

Let **A = {1,2}** and **B = {1,2,3}**. Define a _relation_ **R** as follows:
```latex
R = \{(x,y) \in A \times B \mid \frac{x-y}{2} \in \Z \}
```

#DiscussionQuestion Which ordered pairs are included in the relation **R**?
Can **R** be considered a function?
