## Overloading

[[examples/cpp-overloading]]
```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int sum(int a, int b)
{
  return a+b;
}

//same function/namespace, different parameters
double sum(double a, double b)
{
  return a+b;
}

int main()
{
  cout << sum(10, 20) << '\n'
       << sum(1.0, 1.5) << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

## Templates

[[examples/cpp-templates]]
```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

template <typename T>
T sum(T a, T b)
{
  T result;
  result = a + b;
  return result;
}

int main()
{
  int i=5, j=6, k;
  double f=2.0, g=0.5, h;
  k=sum<int>(i, j);
  h=sum<double>(f, g);

  cout << k << endl;
  cout << h << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

# Memory Model

The programming in this course will have you directly manipulating _memory_. Before that, we first need to clarify what exactly we mean by _memory_. 

Your program, and any variables it creates, live in the memory of your computer. This memory is a limited resource. Use too much and the computer slows; use more than you have and the program crashes!

## Memory as a Tape

You can think of memory as a continuous tape of addressable _cells_

```c++
int x; float y = 3.14; char z = 'z';
```
| Addr. | 0x009 | 0x00A | 0x00B | 0x00C | ... |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Value | ? | ‘z’ | ? | 3.14 | ... |
| Variable | x | z | | y | ... |


Of course, not all datum fit neatly into a fixed-size _cell_, but this model is good enough to discuss what happens during code execution.

## Memory Diagrams

When writing programs, we rarely concern ourselves with the underlying particulars of memory. Those details are abstracted away in high level programming languages.

A more common way of representing the state of memory is using _memory diagrams_.

# Pointers in C++

A _pointer_ is a variable that stores a memory address

## Address-of (&) Operator

The & operator is used to obtain the memory address of an existing variable and is commonly used to initialize pointer variables.

[[examples/ptr-addr-of]]
```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  int x;
  float y = 3.14;

  cout << x << &x << endl  // <unknown int> <memory-address>
       << y << &y;         // 3.14 <memory-address>

  return 0;
}
```
