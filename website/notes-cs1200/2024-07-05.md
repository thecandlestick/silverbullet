# Equivalence Relations

#Definition Let **R** be a relation on a set **A**. **R** is an **equivalence relation** if and only if **R** is _reflexive, symmetric,_ and _transitive_

_example:_
Let **A** be a set with partition **{A_0, A_1, ..., A_n}** and let **R** be a relation on **A** such that:
```latex
xRy \Leftrightarrow \exists A_i \text{ such that }x,y \in A_i
```

This relation has a special name. It is the **relation induced by the partition** given.

If we let **A = {0,1,2,3,4}** and consider the partition **{{0,3,4},{1},{2}}**, then the _relation induced by the partition_ is 

**R = {(0,0), (0,3), (0,4), (1,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,3), (3,4), (4,0), (4,3), (4,4)}**

#DiscussionQuestion Is **R** an _equivalence relation_? Is this the same for all _relations induced by partitions_?

## Equivalence Classes

#Definition Suppose **R** is a relation on a set **A**. For each element **a** in **A**, the **equivalence class** of **a**, denoted [a], is the set of all elements **x** in **A** such that **x** is related to **a** by **R**  
```latex
[a] = \{x\in A\mid xRa\}
```

In general, a relation **R** has as many _equivalence classes_ as there are elements in **A**. Oftentimes, however, we are concerned only with the **distinct equivalence classes** of **R**. That is, all possible sets representing an _equivalence class_ but not tied to a particular element in **A**

_example:_
Let **A = {{1},{2},{3},{1,2},{1,3},{2,3},{1,2,3}}**
Define a relation **R** on **A** such that:
```latex
aRb \Leftrightarrow \text{least element in }a = \text{ least element in }b
```

Then **R = {({1},{1}), ({1},{1,2}), ({1,2},{1}), ({1},{1,3}), 
({1,3},{1}), ({1},{1,2,3}), ({1,2,3},{1}), ({1,2},{1,3}), 
({1,3},{1,2}), ({1,2},{1,2,3}), ({1,2,3},{1,2}), ({1,3},{1,2,3}), ({1,2,3},{1,3}), ({2},{2,3}), ({2,3},{2})}**

List the following _equivalence classes_:
* [{1}] = {{1}, {1,2}, {1,3}, {1,2,3}} **({1,2},{1})**
* [{2}] = {{2}, {2,3}}
* [{3}] = {{3}}

### Properties of Equivalence Classes

#Theorem The following statements are true of all _equivalence relations_ **R** on a set **A**

**R is:**
* reflexive
* Symmetric
* transitive

```latex
\text{If }aRb, \text{ then }[a] = [b]
```

xRa aRb xRb

yRb bRa yRa
```latex
\text{If }a,b \in A,\text{ then either } [a] \cap [b] = \emptyset \text{ or }[a] = [b]
```

suppose xRa and xRb but ~(aRb)

Then by symmetry, aRx, and by transitivity (aRx xRb), aRb, a contradiction
```latex
\{[a] \mid a \in A\} \text{ is a partition of A}
```

non-empty (reflexive)
mutually exclusive (Thm 2)
exhaust (reflexive)

#DiscussionQuestion Think carefully about the definition of _reflexive, symmetric, and transitive_. Do they provide some intuition on why the theorems above are true?

## Congruence & Modulo

Consider a relation **R** defined on the set of integers such that:
```latex
mRn \Leftrightarrow k|(m-n)
```
where **k** is some positive integer

This relation is known as **congruence modulo k** due to the fact that it possesses the property that any two integers **m,n** are related if and only if **m _mod_ k = n _mod_ k = 0**.

* Is _congruence modulo k_ a _reflexive_ relation?

```latex
mRm \Leftrightarrow k|(m-m)\\
\Leftrightarrow k|0\\
\Leftrightarrow \exists i \in \Z \text{ such that } i\times k = 0
```

Regardless of the choice of **m** or **k**, it is clear to see that the choice of **i = 0** demonstrates that **R** is _reflexive_

* Is _congruence modulo k_ a _symmetric_ relation?

```latex
\text{Suppose }mRn \Leftrightarrow \exists i \in \Z \text{ such that }i \times k = (m - n)\\
\Leftrightarrow i = \frac{m-n}{k} \text{ is an integer}\\
\text{Now consider the symmetric relationship }nRm \Leftrightarrow \exists j \in \Z \text{ such that }j \times k = (n - m)\\
\text{Let }j = -i, \text{ then }j \times k = -i \times k\\
 = -(\frac{m-n}{k})k = \frac{n-m}{k}k = (n-m)  
```

Therefore, regardless of the choice of **m,n,k**. We can select **i,j** to demonstrate that **R** is _symmetric_

* Is _congruence modulo k_ a _transitive_ relation?

Using the property:
```latex
mRn \Leftrightarrow m \% k = n \% k = 0
```

We can see that,
```latex
mRn \land nRw \Leftrightarrow (m \% k = n \% k = 0) \land (n \% k = w \% k = 0)\\
 \Leftrightarrow m \% k = n \% k = w \% k = 0 
```

And by specification,
```latex
m \% k = w \% k = 0 \Leftrightarrow mRw
```

Therefore, regardless of the choice of **m,n,w**, the properties of _congruence modulo k_ dictate that it must be _transitive_

#DiscussionQuestion What are the _distinct equivalence classes_ of _congruence modulo 3_?

```latex
mRn \Leftrightarrow 3|(m-n)\\

[a] = \{x \in \Z \mid xRa\} = \{x \in \Z \mid 3|(x-a)\} = \{x \in \Z \mid \exists k \in \Z \text{ such that } 3k = x-a\} = \{x \in \Z \mid \exists k \in \Z \text{ such that } x = 3k+a\}\\
[0] = \{x \in \Z \mid \exists k \in \Z \text{ such that } x = 3k+0\}\\
[1] = \{x \in \Z \mid \exists k \in \Z \text{ such that } x = 3k+1\}\\
[2] = \{x \in \Z \mid \exists k \in \Z \text{ such that } x = 3k+2\}\\
[3] = \{x \in \Z \mid \exists k \in \Z \text{ such that } x = 3k+3\}\\
...
```



# Partial Order Relations

#Definition A relation **R** on a set **A** is a **partial order relation** if and only if **R** is _reflexive, anti-symmetric, and transitive_

_example:_
Recall the relation
```latex
x R y \Leftrightarrow x \leq y
```
on the set of real numbers

```latex
xRx \Leftrightarrow x \leq x \text{ is true }\forall x \in \R\\
\therefore R \text{ is reflexive}
```

```latex
xRy \land yRx \Leftrightarrow (x \leq y) \land (y \leq x)\text{ is true only if }x = y\\
\therefore R \text{ is anti-symmetric} 
```

```latex
\forall x,y,z \in R, (x \leq y) \land (y \leq z) \rightarrow (x \leq z) \text{ by well-known principles of algebra}\\
\Leftrightarrow xRy \land yRz \rightarrow xRz\\
\therefore R \text{ is transitive}  
```

Therefore, **R** is a _partial order_ relation

Because _partial orders_ are often used to formalize the concept of **precedence** between elements of a set, a special symbol is used for these types of relations
```latex
a \prec b \Leftrightarrow \text{a relates to b [in a partial order relation]}\\
\Leftrightarrow \text{a precedes b}\\
and\\
a \preccurlyeq b \Leftrightarrow \text{a relates to or is equal to b}

```
Often, the symbols above are read as “a is less than or equal to b.” This should not be confused, however, with the specific relation expressed by 
```latex
aRb \Leftrightarrow a \leq b
```

_example:_ **Precedence relationships**

Consider the computer science courses offered at S&T:
* **CS1200** - Discrete Mathematics
* **CS1500** - Computational Problem Solving
* **CS1570** - Intro to C++ Programming
* **CS1575** - Data Structures
* **CS2300** - Databases
* **CS2500** - Algorithms
* ...

Students are free to take whatever courses they wish, but the system of prerequisites imposes a _partial order_ for when to take what

```latex
x\preccurlyeq y \Leftrightarrow xRy\\
\Leftrightarrow \text{ course x is a prerequisite for or is equal to course y }
```

#DiscussionQuestion
* Is **R** reflexive?
* Is **R** anti-symmetric?
* Is **R** transitive?

_example:_ **Lexicographic order**

Let **S** be a set of character strings and let **R** be a relation on **S** that is defined as follows:

For any two strings
```latex
s_1 = a_1a_2...a_m\\
s_2 = b_1b_2...b_n\\
m,n \in \Z^+
```

1. If **m <= n** and **a_i = b_i** for all **i = 1,2,...,m** then
```latex
a_1a_2...a_m \preccurlyeq b_1b_2...b_m...b_n
  
```
2. If for some integer **k** with **k <= m, k <= n,** and **k >= 1**,
**a_i = b_i** for all **i = 1,2,...,k-1** and **a_k != b_k** but **a_k R b_k** then
```latex
a_1a_2...a_{k-1}a_k...a_m \preccurlyeq b_1b_2...b_n  
```
3. If **e** is the empty string and **s** is any string in **S** then
```latex
e \preccurlyeq s
  
```

The relation above, combined with a _partial order relation_ for individual characters, is an example of a _partial order relation_ for lexicographic strings 

#DiscussionQuestion Based on the relation defined above, are the following strings related?
```latex
x \preccurlyeq xx ?\\
xxxy \preccurlyeq xxy ?\\
e \preccurlyeq xy ?
```

# Hasse Diagrams

Think back to illustrating relations with _directed graphs_. Complex relations on large sets with many elements can become difficult to visualize as graphs. 

#Definition A **Hasse diagram** is a simplified representation of a _partial order relation_ that can be obtained as follows:
1. **Begin with the directed graph representation. Draw the points of this graph so that all arrows point upwards**
2. **Eliminate all “self-loops” representing x R x**
3. **Eliminate all arrows whose existence is implied by transitivity**
4. **Convert all arrows to solid lines**

_example:_
Let **A = {1,2,3,9,18}** and let **R** be the _Divides_ relation
#BoardQuestion Draw the directed graph of **R** and convert to a _Hasse diagram_

#BoardQuestion The _Hasse diagram_ representation for the _Subset_ relation (a R b means “a is a subset of b”) is depicted below.

![](img/hasse-subset.png)
Convert this back into a _directed graph_

# Comparability & Compatibility

#Definition Given a _partial order relation_ **R** on set **A**, elements **a,b** are **comparable** if and only if **a R b** or **b R a**
```latex
aRb \Leftrightarrow a \preccurlyeq b
\Leftrightarrow \text{a is comparable to b}\\
\text{a is not comparable to b} \Leftrightarrow a \npreceq b \land b \npreceq a
```

#Definition If **R** is a _partial order relation_ such that **a R b** or **b R a** for all elements **a,b** then **R** is called a **total order relation**

#Definition For a given _partial order relation_,

Element **a** is the **Greatest element** if and only if
```latex
\forall b \in A, b \preccurlyeq a
```

Element **a** is the **Least element** if and only if
```latex
\forall b \in A, a \preccurlyeq b
```

Element **a** is the **Maximal element** if and only if
```latex
\forall b \in A, b \preccurlyeq a\text{ or }a\text{ is not comparable to }b
```

Element **a** is the **Minimal element** if and only if
```latex
\forall b \in A, a \preccurlyeq b\text{ or }a\text{ is not comparable to }b
```

#DiscussionQuestion Consider the Hasse diagram of the _Subset_ relation.
* Which elements (if any) are the _greatest element(s)_?
* Which elements (if any) are the _least element(s)_?
* Which elements (if any) are the _maximal element(s)_?
* Which elements (if any) are the _minimal element(s)_?

#Definition A **chain** is a subset of a _partial order relation_ in which all the elements are _comparable_

#Definition Given two _partial order relations_, **R** and **S** on a set **A**, we say that **S** is **compatible** with **R** if and only if
```latex
\forall a,b \in A, aRb \rightarrow aSb
```

#Definition A _total order relation_ **S** is a **Topological Sorting** of a _partial order_ **R** if **S** is compatible with **R**
