# Welcome to Data Structures!

 Here are some FAQ to get you started:
* **Is there a course website?**
  * Yes! This _is_ the course website. It’s powered by the awesome, free, and open-source [SilverBullet](https://SilverBullet.md). Check it out if you’re in the market for a personal note-taking/knowledge-base solution.
* **Where can I find lecture notes?**
  * Here! Any course material will be hosted on this site for your convenience.
* **How can I keep on top of assignments?**
  * Check out the tentative [[Course Calendar]] which will be updated throughout the semester. Assignments will be posted to https://git-classes.mst.edu/
* **Where will grades be posted?**
  * Right He- er, actually that one’s on [Canvas](https://umsystem.instructure.com/courses/205795) 😅
