# Policies

## Attendance
This course is online-synchronous, so regular attendance at the lectures is expected. I understand during the Summer session some students juggle work as well, so please contact me _in advance_ about schedule conflicts. Unexcused absences will drop your grade and exclude you from extra credit opportunities.

## Late Work
Opportunities to resubmit past assignments will be available **only** to students with zero unexcused absences during the week it was assigned.

## Academic Honesty
All code submitted must be 100% your own work!
Do not copy code from the internet, fellow students, or Large Language Models. Submitted assignments **will** be checked for plagiarism at times throughout the semester, and any instances of academic dishonesty will be taken very seriously.
