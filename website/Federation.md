Federation enables _browsing_, and _synchronizing_ (parts of) spaces outside of the userâ€™s space into your SilverBullet client.

This enables a few things:

* Linking and browsing publicly hosted SilverBullet spaces (or websites adhering to its [[API]]). For instance the [[!silverbullet.md/CHANGELOG|SilverBullet CHANGELOG]] without leaving the comfort of your own SilverBullet client.
* Reusing content from externally hosted sources, such as:
  * _Templates_, e.g. by federating with `silverbullet.md/template` will give you access to the example templates hosted there without manually copying and pasting them and automatically pull in the latest version. So you can, for instance, use `render [[!silverbullet.md/template/page]]` to use the [[template/page]] template.
  * _Data_: such as tasks, item, data hosted elsewhere that you want to query from your own space.

**Note:** Federation does not support authentication yet, so all federated spaces need to be unauthenticated and will be _read-only_.

## Browsing
Browsing other publicly hosted spaces is as simple as navigating to a page starting with `!` such as [[!silverbullet.md/CHANGELOG]].

## Federating
To synchronize federated content into your client, you need to list these URIs in your [[SETTINGS]] under the `federate` key. For instance:

```yaml
federate:
- uri: silverbullet.md/template
```

This will synchronize all content under `!silverbullet.md` with a `template` prefix (so all templates hosted there) locally.

Currently, content can only be synchronized in read-only mode, so you can not edit the synchronized files. This will likely change in the future.

## Hosting
Tooling to make hosting public spaces is still a work in progress.
