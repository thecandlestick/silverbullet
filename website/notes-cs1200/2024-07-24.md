# Trees

#Definition A graph is **circuit-free** (or **acyclic**) if and only if it contains no _circuits_

#Definition A **tree** is a _connected, acyclic graph_

#Definition A **forest** is an _acyclic_ graph that is not _connected_

![](../img/example-trees.png)

![](img/not-trees.png)

Note that _trees_ cannot have parallel edges or loops, as those always result in a _circuit_. Therefore, all _trees_ are _simple graphs_

#Theorem A simple graph **G** of **n** vertices is a _tree_ if and only if **G** is _connected_ and has exactly **n-1** edges

#ChallengeQuestion Can you give an argument for the theorem above using _Mathematical Induction_?

## Rooted Trees

#Definition A **rooted tree** designates one vertex as the **root**, and characterizes the rest of the vertices relative to the _root_.

### Binary Trees

#Definition In a **binary tree**, vertices have a parent and a maximum of two children. These children are typically distinguished as the _left-child_ or _right-child_

## Applications of Trees

Trees are widely applied to many problems both in and out of computer science. Below are just a few such examples

_Decision Trees_

## Spanning Trees

#Definition A **spanning tree** of an undirected graph **G** is a _sub-graph_ of **G** that is both a _tree_ and includes every element of **V(G)**

_example:_ **Railway planning**

Suppose that a shipping company plans to build a series of railroads connecting several major cities. The surveyors have determined the routes that would be possible to build, depicted by edges in the graph below
![](../img/city-graph.png)

To cut costs, the company wants to ensure that every city is reachable in their rail system using the fewest possible connections.

_Circuits_ are therefore, an unnecessary luxury. The company seeks a _spanning tree_ of the surveyors’ graph 

![](../img/city-spanning-tree.png)

But wait! Shorter rails are cheaper to build than longer ones. To truly minimize costs, the company should find a way to connect all cities using the least total distance 

#Definition A **minimum spanning tree** of a weighted graph is the _spanning tree_ with the lowest total weight

![](../img/city-weighted-graph.png)

There are several methods of forming a _minimum spanning tree_ efficiently. Two such algorithms are described below:

### Kruskal’s Algorithm

_Kruskal’s Algorithm_ takes a given _connected_ graph **G** and generates a _subgraph_ **H** that is guaranteed to be a _minimum spanning tree_

1. Set **V(H) = V(G)**, **E(H) = { }** to begin
2. Let **n** represent **|V(H)|** and let **m** represent **|E(H)|** (initially, 0)
3. Create set **S = E(G)**
  4. Let **e** be an edge from **S** with the minimal weight
  5. If adding **e** to **E(H)** would _not_ create a circuit, do so
  6. Remove **e** from **S**
7. Repeat steps 4-7 if **m** < **n-1**

### Prim’s Algorithm

_Prim’s Algorithm_ takes a different approach, beginning at an arbitrarily chosen starting node and growing the MST outward from that point

1. Set **V(H)** to any starting vertex **a** in **G** initially
2. Create set **S = V(G) - a**
  3. Locate edge **e** such that
     * **e** has one endpoint in **V(H)** and one endpoint (**b**) in **S**
     * **e** has the minimal weight of all such edges
  4. Add **e** and **b** to **H**
  5. Remove **b** from **S**
6. If **S** is non-empty, repeat steps 3-6
